<h2>THE MARTYRS IN THE CATACOMBS.</h2>

<p class="center">BY CHARLES J. PETERSON.
</p>

<div class="poemblock">

<div>They lie all around me, countless in their number,</div>
<div class="indent3">Each martyr with his palm.</div>
<div>No torture now can rack them: safe they slumber,</div>
<div class="indent4">Hushed in eternal calm!</div>

<div>I read the rude inscriptions, written weeping,</div>
<div class="indent3">At night with hurried tears.</div>
<div>Yet what a tale they tell! their secret keeping</div>
<div class="indent4">Through all these thousand years.</div>

<div>"In Pace." Yes, at peace. By sword, or fire,</div>
<div class="indent3">Or cross, or lictor's rod&mdash;</div>
<div>Virgin, or matron; youth, or gray-haired sire:</div>
<div class="indent4">For all, the peace of God.</div>

<div>"In Christo." Died in Christ. Oh, tragic story!</div>
<div class="indent3">Yet, over shouts, and cries,</div>
<div>And lion's roar, they heard the saints in glory</div>
<div class="indent4">Singing from Paradise.</div>

<div>"Ad Deum." Went to God. Wide swung the portal;</div>
<div class="indent3">Dim sank the sands away;</div>
<div>And, chanting "Alleluia," the immortal</div>
<div class="indent4">Passed to Eternal Day.</div>

<div>Agnes, Cecilia! Names undying ever,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent3">What's Cæsar's gain to this?</div>
<div>He lived for self; they for their high endeavour.</div>
<div class="indent4">His, fame; theirs, endless bliss.</div>

<div>And pagan Rome herself? Her wisest teacher</div>
<div class="indent3">Could teach but how to die!</div>
<div>Sad, hopeless emperor, echoing the Preacher,</div>
<div class="indent4">"All, all is vanity."</div>

<div>He slew the martyrs. Yet, through ages crying,</div>
<div class="indent3">This noble truth they give:</div>
<div>"Life is but birth-throes. Death itself, not dying.</div>
<div class="indent4">We pass to God&mdash;to live."</div>

<div>O blessed hope! O faith that conquers sorrow!</div>
<div class="indent3">Pain, heart-break, all shall cease.</div>
<div>They are but gateways to a glad to-morrow.</div>
<div class="indent4">"In Pace." God is peace.</div>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The writer having made the early Christian
Catacombs a special study for several
years, and his larger volume on that subject
having been received with great favour in Great
Britain, the United States, and Canada, has
endeavoured in this story to give as popular
an account as he could of early Christian life
and character as illustrated by these interesting
memorials of the primitive Church. He has
been especially careful to maintain historical
accuracy in all his statements of fact, and in
the filling up of details he has endeavoured
to preserve the historical "keeping" of the
picture. Persons wishing to pursue the study
of the Catacombs still further are referred to
the Author's special work on that subject.
See note at the end of this volume.</p>

<h2>THE CATACOMBS.</h2>

<p class="center">BY HARRIET ANNIE WILKINS.</p>

<p class="center">"Miles after miles of graves, and not one word or<br /> sign of the gloominess
or death."&mdash;<i>Professor Jules De Launay.</i></p>

<div class="poemblock2">
<div>Miles after miles of graves,</div>
<div class="indent3">League after league of tombs,</div>
<div>And not one sign of spectre Death,</div>
<div class="indent3">Waving his shadowy plumes;</div>
<div>Hope, beautiful and bright,</div>
<div class="indent3">Spanning the arch above</div>
<div>Faith, gentle, overcoming Faith,</div>
<div class="indent4">And Love, God's best gift, Love.</div>

<div>For early Christians left</div>
<div class="indent3">Their darlings to their rest,</div>
<div>As mothers leave their little ones</div>
<div class="indent3">When the sun gilds the west;</div>
<div>No mourning robes of black,</div>
<div class="indent3">No crape upon the doors,</div>
<div>For the victorious palm-bearers,</div>
<div class="indent4">Who tread the golden floors.</div>

<div>Arrayed in garments white,</div>
<div class="indent3">No mournful dirges pealing,</div>
<div>Bearing green branches in their hands,</div>
<div class="indent3">Around the tomb they're kneeling;</div>
<div>This was their marching song,</div>
<div class="indent3">"By death we are not holden;"</div>
<div>And this their glorious funeral hymn,</div>
<div class="indent4">"Jerusalem the golden."</div>

<div>Beautiful girls sleep there,</div>
<div class="indent3">Waiting the Bridegroom's call.</div>
<div>Each lamp is burning brilliantly,</div>
<div class="indent3">While the bright shadows fall;</div>
<div>And baby martyrs passed</div>
<div class="indent3">Straight to the great I AM,</div>
<div>While sturdier soldiers carved o'er each,</div>
<div class="indent4">"Victor, God's little lamb."</div>

<div>Miles after miles of graves,</div>
<div class="indent3">League after league of tombs,</div>
<div>The cross upon each conqueror's brow</div>
<div class="indent3">Light up the catacombs;</div>
<div>"'Tis in this sign we conquer."</div>
<div class="indent3">Sounds on the blood-stained track;</div>
<div>"'Tis in this sign we conquer,"</div>
<div class="indent4">We gladly answer back.</div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">On a bright spring morning in the year of our
Lord 303&mdash;it was in the "Ides of March,"
about the middle of the month, but the air was
balmy as that of June in our northern clime&mdash;two
note-worthy-looking men were riding along
the famous Appian Way, near the city of Rome
The elder of the two, a man of large size and of
mighty thews and sinews, was mounted on a strong
and richly-caparisoned horse. He wore the armour
of a Roman centurion&mdash;a lorica or cuirass, made
of plates of bronze, fastened to a flexible body of
leather; and cothurni, or a sort of laced boots,
leaching to mid-leg. On his back hung his round
embossed shield; by his side, in its sheath, his
short, straight sword, and on his head was a
burnished helmet, with a sweeping horsehair crest.
His face was bronzed with the sun of many climes.
But when, for a moment, he removed his helmet
to cool his brow, one saw that his forehead was
high and white. His hair curled close to his head,
except where it was worn bare at his temples
by the chafing of his helmet, and was already
streaked with grey, although he looked not more
than five-and forty years of age. Yet the eagle
glance of his eye was undimmed, and his firm-set
muscles, the haughty expression of his countenance,
and the high courage of his bearing, gave
evidence that his natural strength was not abated.</p>

<p>His companion contrasted strongly in every
respect. He had a slender, graceful figure, a
mobile and expressive face, a mouth of almost
feminine softness and beauty, dark and languishing
eyes, and long, flowing hair. He wore a
snowy toga, with a brilliant scarlet border of
what is still known as "Greek fret;" and over
this, fastened by a brooch at his throat, a flowing
cloak. On his head sat jauntily a soft felt hat,
not unlike those still worn by the Italian peasantry,
and on his feet were low-laced shoes or
sandals. Instead of a sword, he wore at his side
a metal case for his reed-pen and for a scroll of
papyrus. He was in the bloom and beauty of
youth, apparently not more than twenty years
of age.</p>

<p>The elder of the two was the Roman officer
Flaccus Sertorius, a centurion of the 12th Legion,
returning with his Greek secretary, Isidorus, from
the town of Albano, about seventeen miles from
Rome, whither he had been sent on business of
state.</p>

<p>"This new edict of the Emperor's," remarked
Sertorius to his secretary, with an air of affable
condescension, "is likely to give us both work
enough to do before long."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency forgets," replied Isidorus,
with an obsequious inclination of the head, "that
your humble secretary has not the same means
of learning affairs of state as his noble master."</p>

<p>"Oh, you Greeks learn everything!" said the
centurion, with a rather contemptuous laugh.
"Trust you for that."</p>

<p>"We try to make ourselves useful to our
patrons," replied the young man, "and it seems
to be a sort of hereditary habit, for my Athenian
ancestors were proverbial for seeking to know
some new thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, new manners, new customs, new religions;
why, your very name indicates your adherence to the
new-fangled worship of Isis."</p>

<p>"I hold not altogether that way," replied the
youth. "I belong rather to the eclectic school.
My father, Apollodorus, was a priest of Phoebus,
and named me, like himself, from the sungod,
whom he worshipped; but I found the party of
Isis fashionable at court, so I even changed my
name and colours to the winning side. When
one is at Rome, you know, he must do as the
Romans do."</p>

<p>"Yes, like the degenerate Romans, who forsake
the old gods, under whom the State was great
and virtuous and strong," said the soldier, with
an angry gesture. "The more gods, the worse
the world becomes. But this new edict will
make short work of some of them."</p>

<p>"With the Christians you mean," said the
supple Greek. "A most pernicious sect, that
deserve extermination with fire and sword."</p>

<p>"I know little about them," replied Sertorius,
with a sneer, "save that they have increased
prodigiously of late. Even in the army and the
palace are those known to favour their obscene
and contemptible doctrines."</p>

<p>"'Tis whispered that even their sacred highnesses
the Empresses Prisca and Valeria are
infected with their grovelling superstition," said
the Greek secretary. "Certain it is, they seem
to avoid being present at the public sacrifices, as
they used to be. But the evil sect has its followers
chiefly among the slaves and vile plebs of
the poorest Transtiberine region of Rome."</p>

<p>"What do they worship, anyhow?" asked the
centurion, with an air of languid curiosity. "They
seem to have no temples, nor altars, nor sacrifices."</p>

<p>"They have dark and secret and abominable
rites," replied the fawning Greek, eager to gratify
the curiosity of his patron with popular slanders
against the Christians. "'Tis said they worship
a low-born peasant, who was crucified for sedition.
Some say he had an ass's head,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but that, I doubt
not, is a vulgar superstition; and one of our
poets, the admirable Lucian, remarks that their
doctrine was brought to Rome by a little hook-nosed
Jew, named Paulus, who was beheaded by
the divine Nero over yonder near the Ostian
gate, beside the pyramid of Cestius, which you
may see amongst the cypresses. They have many
strange usages. Their funeral customs, especially,
differ very widely from the Greek or Roman ones.
They bury the body, with many mysterious rites,
in vaults or chambers underground, instead of
burning it on a funeral pyre. They are rank
atheists, refusing to worship the gods, or even to
throw so much as a grain of incense on their altar,
or place a garland of flowers before their shrines,
or even have their images in their houses. They
are a morose, sullen, and dangerous people, and
are said to hold hideous orgies at their secret
assemblies underground, where they banquet on
the body of a newly-slain child.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> See yonder,"
he continued, pointing to a low-browed arch
almost concealed by trees in a neighbouring garden,
"is the entrance to one of their secret crypts,
where they gather to celebrate their abominable
rites, surrounded by the bones and ashes of the
dead. A vile and craven set of wretches; they
are not fit to live.</p>

<p>"They are not all cravens; to that I can bear
witness," interrupted Sertorius. "I knew a fellow
in my own company&mdash;Lannus was his name&mdash;who,
his comrades said, was a Christian. He
was the bravest and steadiest fellow in the legion;
&mdash;saved my life once in Libya;&mdash;rushed between
me and a lion, which sprang from a thicket as
I stopped to let my horse drink at a stream&mdash;as
it might be the Anio, there. The lion's fangs
met in his arm, but he never winced. He may
believe what he pleases for me. I like not this
blood-hound business of hunting down honest
men because they worship gods of their own.
But the Emperor's edict is written, as you may
say, with the point of a dagger&mdash;'The Christian
religion must everywhere be destroyed.'"</p>

<p>"And quite right, too, your Excellency," said
the soft-smiling Greek. "They are seditious
conspirators, the enemies of Cæsar and of Rome."</p>

<p>"A Roman soldier does not need to learn of
thee, hungry Greekling,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> exclaimed the centurion,
haughtily, "what is his duty to his country!"</p>

<p>"True, most noble sir," faltered the discomfited
secretary, yet with a vindictive glance from his
treacherous eyes. "Your Excellency is always
right."</p>

<p>For a time they rode on in silence, the secretary
falling obsequiously a little to the rear. It
was now high noon, and the crowd and bustle
on the Appian Way redoubled. This Queen of
Roads<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ran straight as an arrow up-hill and
down from Rome to Capua and Brundisium, a
distance of over three hundred miles. Though
then nearly six hundred years old, it was as firm
as the day it was laid, and after the lapse of
fifteen hundred years more, during which "the
Goth, the Christian, Time, War, Flood and Fire,"
have devastated the land, its firm lava pavement
of broad basaltic slabs seems as enduring as ever.
On every side rolled the undulating Campagna,
now a scene of melancholy desolation, then
cultivated like a garden, abounding in villas and
mansions whose marble columns gleamed snowy
white through the luxuriant foliage of their
embosoming myrtle and laurel groves. On either
side of the road were the stately tombs of Rome's
mighty dead-her prætors, proconsuls, and
senators some, like the mausoleum of Cæcilia Metella,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
rising like a solid fortress; others were
like little wayside altars, but all were surrounded
by an elegantly kept green sward, adorned with
parterres of flowers. Their ruins now rise like
stranded wrecks above the sea of verdure of the
tomb-abounding plain. On every side are tombs
&mdash;tombs above and tombs below&mdash;the graves of
contending races, the sepulchres of vanished generations.
Across the vast field of view stretched,
supported high in air on hundreds of arches, like
a Titan procession, the Marcian Aqueduct, erected
B.C. 146, which after two thousand years brings
to the city of Rome an abundant supply of the
purest water from the far distant Alban Mountains,
which present to our gaze to-day the same
serrated outline and lovely play of colour that
delighted the eyes of Horace and Cicero.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer the gates of the city, it
became difficult to thread their way through the
throngs of eager travellers&mdash;gay lecticæ or silken-curtained
carriages and flashing chariots, conveying
fashionable ladies and the gilded gallants
of the city to the elegant villas without the walls
&mdash;processions of consuls and proconsuls with
their guards, and crowds of peasants bringing in
the panniers of their patient donkeys fruits, vegetables,
and even snow from the distant Soracte,
protected from the heat by a straw matting&mdash;just
as they do in Italy to-day. The busy scene

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN CÆSAR'S PALACE.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Passing beneath the even then grim and hoary
archway of the Porta Capena, or Capuan Gate,
with the dripping aqueduct above it, the centurion
and his secretary traversed rapidly the crowded
streets of a fashionable suburb&mdash;now mere
mouldering mounds of desolation&mdash;to the Imperial
Palace on the Palatine Hill. This eminence,
which is now a mass of crumbling ruins,
honey-combed with galleries and subterranean corridors
through what was once the stately apartments of
the Lords of the World, where wandering tourists
peer and explore and artists sketch the falling
arch or fading fresco of the banquet halls and
chambers of a long line of emperors, was then the
scene of life and activity, of pomp and splendour.
Marble courts and columned porticos stretched
on in almost endless vistas, covering many acres
of ground. Flashing fountains leaping sunward
sparkled in the beams of noonday, diffusing a
coolness through the air, which was fragrant with
blossoms of the orange and magnolia trees growing
in the open courts. Snowy statuary gleamed
amid the vivid foliage, and beneath the shadow
of the frescoed corridors.</p>

<p>Having dismounted at the outer court and
given their horses to obsequious grooms, Sertorius
and the Greek repaired each to a marble bath to
remove the stains of travel before entering the
presence of the Emperor. Having made their
toilet they advanced to the inner court. The
guards who stood in burnished mail at the portal
of the palace respectfully made way for the well-known
imperial officer, but were about to obstruct
the passage of the Greek secretary, when with a
gesture of authority Sertorius bade the soldier
to permit the man to pass.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Max, as a rule: but wrong this
time. He accompanies me on business of state,
before the Emperor."</p>

<p>Two lictors in white tunics with scarlet hem,
and bearing each the fasces or bundle of rods
bound with filets from the top of which projected
a polished silver axe, came forward and conducted
the centurion into the Imperial presence chamber,
the secretary remaining in an ante-room.</p>

<p>The lictors draw aside a heavy gold-embroidered
curtain, and Sertorius stood in the presence of the
Lord of the World, the man to whom divine
honours had been ascribed, who held in his hand
the lives of all his myriads of subjects, and the
word of whose mouth uttering his despotic will
might consign even the loftiest, without form or
process of law, to degradation or death.</p>

<p>Let us note for a moment what manner of man
this god on earth, this Diocletian, whose name is
remembered with abhorrence and execration, the
degenerate usurper of the august name of the
Cæsars, may be. He sits in an ivory, purple-cushioned
chair, near a table of inlaid precious
woods. His short and obese figure is enswathed
in the folds of an ample crimson-bordered toga,
or fine linen vestment of flowing folds. His
broad, coarse features are of plebeian cast, for
he had been originally a Dalmatian slave, or at
least the son of a slave; but the long-continued
exercise of despotic authority had given an
imperious haughtiness to his bearing. He was now
in his fifty-eighth year, but his features, coarsened
and bloated by sensuality, gave him a much older
aspect. He was dictating to a secretary who sat
at the table writing with a reed pen on a
parchment scroll, when the lictors, lowering their fasces
and holding their hands above their eyes, as if
to protect their dazzled eyes from the effulgence
of the noonday sun, advanced into the apartment.</p>

<p>"May it please your divine Majesty," said one
of the servile lictors, "the centurion whom you
summoned to your presence awaits your Imperial
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Most humbly at your Imperial Majesty's service,"
said Sertorius, coming forward with a
profound inclination of his uncovered head. He had
left his helmet and sword in the ante-chamber.</p>

<p>"Flaccus Sertorius, I have heard that thou art
a brave and faithful soldier, skilled in affairs of
State as well as in the art of war. I have need
of such to carry out my purpose here in Rome.
Vitalius, the scribe," he went on, with an allusive
gesture toward the secretary, "is copying a decree
to be promulgated to the utmost limits of the
empire against the pestilent atheism of the
accursed sect of Christians, who have spawned and
multiplied like frogs throughout the realm. This
execrable superstition must be everywhere
destroyed and the worship of the gods revived.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Even hero in Rome the odious sect swarms
like vermin, and 'tis even said that the precincts
of this palace are not free. Now, purge me this
city as with a besom of wrath. Spare not young
or old, the lofty or the low; purge even this
palace, and look to it that thy own head be not
the forfeit if you fail. This seal shall be your
warrant;" and lashing himself into rage till the
purple veins stood out like whipcords on his
forehead, he tossed his signet ring across the
table to the scribe, who prepared a legal instrument
to which he affixed the Imperial seal.</p>

<p>"May it please your Imperial Majesty," said
the centurion, with an obeisance, "I am a rude
soldier, unskilled to speak in the Imperial presence;
but I have fought your Majesty's enemies
in Iberia, in Gaul, in Dacia, in Pannonia, and
in Libya, and am ready to fight them anywhere.
Nevertheless, I would fain be discharged from
this office of censor of the city. I know naught,
save by Rumour, who is ever a lying jade, your
Imperial Majesty, against this outlawed sect.
And I know some of them who were brave
soldiers in your Imperial Majesty's service, and
many others are feeble old men or innocent
women and children. I pray you send me rather
to fight against the barbarian Dacians than
against these."</p>

<p>"I was well informed then that you were a
bold fellow," exclaimed the Emperor, his brow
flushing in his anger a deeper hue; "but I have
need of such. Do thy duty, on thy allegiance,
and see that thou soon bring these culprits to
justice. Is it not enough that universal rumour
condemns them? They are pestilent sedition-mongers,
and enemies of the gods and of the
State."</p>

<p>"I, too, am a worshipper of the gods,"
continued the intrepid soldier, "and will fail not to
keep my allegiance to your Imperial Majesty, to
the State, and to those higher powers," and he
walked backward out of the Imperial presence.
As he rejoined his secretary a cloud sat on his
brow. He was moody and taciturn, and
evidently little pleased with his newly-imposed
duties. But the confirmed habit of unquestioning
obedience inherent in a Roman soldier led
to an almost mechanical acceptance of his
uncongenial task. Emerging from the outer court
he proceeded to his own house, in the populous
region of the Aventine Hill, now a deserted
waste, covered with kitchen gardens and
vineyards. In the meantime we turn to another part
of the great Imperial palace.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center">EMPRESS AND SLAVE.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Using the time-honoured privilege of ubiquity
accorded to imaginative writers, we
beg to conduct our readers to a part of the stately
palace of Diocletian, where, if they had really
been found in their own proper persons, it would
have been at the peril of their lives. After
fifteen long centuries have passed, we may explore
without let or hindrance the most private
apartments of the once all-potent masters of the
world. We may roam through their unroofed
banquet-chambers. We may gaze upon the
frescoes, carvings, and mosaics which met their eyes.
We may behold the evidences of their luxury
and profligacy. We may thread the secret
corridors and galleries connecting the chambers of
the palace&mdash;all now open to the light of day.</p>

<p>We may even penetrate to the boudoirs and
tiring rooms of the proud dames of antiquity.
We may even examine at our will the secrets of
the toilet&mdash;the rouge pots and vases for cosmetics
and unguents, the silver mirrors, fibulas or
brooches, armlets and jewels, and can thus
reconstruct much of that old Roman life which has
vanished forever from the face of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>By the light of modern exploration and discovery,
therefore, we may enter the private
apartments of ladies of the Imperial household, and
in imagination re-furnish these now desolate and
ruinous chambers with all the luxury and
magnificence of their former prime. A room of
commodious size is paved with tesselated marble
slabs, adorned with borders and designs of
brilliant mosaic. The walls are also marble, save
where an elegant fresco on a stucco ground&mdash;flowers
or fruit or graceful landscape<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;greet the
eye. A small fountain throws up its silver spray,
imparting a grateful coolness to the air.
Windows, void of glass, but mantled and screened by
climbing plants and rare exotics, look out into a
garden where snowy marble statues are relieved
against the dark green of the cypress and ilex.
Around the room are busts and effigies of the
Imperial household or of historical characters.
There is, however, a conspicuous absence of the
mythological figures, whose exquisite execution
does not atone for their sensuous conception,
which, rescued from the <i>debris</i> of ancient civilization,
crowd all the Art-galleries of Europe. That
this is not the result of accident but of design is
seen by an occasional empty pedestal or niche.
Distributed at intervals are couches and tables of
costly woods, inlaid with ivory, and bronze and
silver candelabra, lamps and other household
objects of ornament or use. Sitting in an ivory
chair amid all this elegance and luxury was a
lady in the very flower of her youth, of queenly
dignity and majestic beauty. She wore a snowy
<i>stola</i>, or robe of finest linen, with purple border,
flowing in ample folds to her sandaled feet
Over this was negligently thrown a saffron-coloured
veil of thinnest tissue. She held in her
hand a burnished silver mirror, at which she
glanced carelessly from time to time, while a
comely slave with dark lustrous eyes and finely-formed
features carefully brushed and braided
her long and rippling hair.</p>

<p>This queenly presence was the young and
lovely Empress Valeria, the daughter of Diocletian
and Prisca, and wife of the co-Emperor,
Galerius Cæsar. The object of envy of all the
women of Borne, she lived to become within a
few short years the object of their profoundest
commiseration. Of her even the unsympathetic
Gibbon remarks that "her melancholy adventures
might furnish a very singular subject for
tragedy."</p>

<p>"Nay, now, Callirhoë," said the Empress, with
a weary smile, "that will do! Put up my hair
and bind it with this fillet," and she held out a
gold-embroidered ribband. "Thou knowest I
care not for the elaborate coiffure that is now so
fashionable."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty needs it not," said the slave,
speaking Greek with a low sweet voice, and with
an Attic purity of accent. "As one of your own
poets has said, you appear 'when unadorned,
adorned the most.'"</p>

<p>"Flatterer," said the Empress, tapping her
gaily and almost caressingly with a plumy fan of
ostrich feathers which she held lightly in one
hand, "you are trying to spoil me."</p>

<p>"Such goodness as thine, sweet mistress," said
the slave, affectionately kissing her hand, "it
would be impossible to spoil."</p>

<p>"Dost know, Callirhoë," said the young
Empress, with a smile of bewitching sweetness, "that
I have a surprise for thee? It is, thou knowest,
my birthday, and in my honour is the banquet
given to-day. But I have a greater pleasure than
the banquet can bestow. I give thee this day
thy freedom. Thou art no more a slave, but the
freedwoman of the Empress Valeria. See, here
are the papers of thy manumission," and she
drew from the girdle of her robe a sealed and
folded parchment, which she handed to the now
emancipated slave.</p>

<p>"Dearest mistress!" exclaimed the faithful
creature, who had thrown herself on the marble
pavement and was kissing the sandaled feet of
the beautiful Empress, but an outburst of sobs
and tears choked her utterance.</p>

<p>"What! weeping!" exclaimed Valeria. "Are
you sorry then?"</p>

<p>"Nay, they are tears of joy," exclaimed the
girl, smiling through her tears, like the sun
shining through a shower; "not that I tire of
thy service; I wish never to leave it. But I
rejoice that my father's daughter can serve thee
no longer as thy slave, but as thy freedwoman."</p>

<p>"I should indeed be sorry to lose thee," said
the august lady with a wistful smile. "If I
thought I should, I would almost regret thy
manumission; for believe me, Callirhoë, I have
need of true friends, and thou, I think, wilt be a
faithful one."</p>

<p>"What! I, but this moment a poor slave, the
friend of the fairest and most envied lady in all
Rome! Nay, now thou laughest at me; but
believe me I am still heart and soul and body
thy most devoted servant."</p>

<p>"I do believe it, child," said the Empress;
"but tell me, pray, why thou speakest in that
proud melancholy tone of thy father? Was he
a freedman?"</p>

<p>"Nay, your Majesty, he was free-born; neither
he nor his fathers were ever in bondage to any
man,"&mdash;and the fair face of the girl was suffused
with the glow of honest pride in the freeborn
blood that flowed in her veins.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, child, if I touched a sore spot in
thy memory. Perchance I may heal it. Money
can do much, men say."</p>

<p>"In this case, dearest mistress, it is powerless.
But from thee I can have no secrets, if you care
to listen to the story of one so long a slave."</p>

<p>"I never knew thou wert aught else, child.
My steward bought thee in the slave market
in the Suburra. Tell me all."</p>

<p>"'Tis a short story, but a sad one, your
Majesty," said the girl, as she went on braiding
her mistress's hair. "My father was a Hebrew
merchant, a dealer in precious stones, well
esteemed in his nation. He lived in Damascus,
where I was born. He named me after the
beautiful fountain near the Jordan of his native
land."</p>

<p>"I thought it had been from the pagan goddess," interrupted the Empress.</p>

<p>"Nay, 'twas from the healing fountain of
Callirhoë, in Judea," continued the girl "When
my mother died, my father was plunged into
inconsolable grief, and fell ill, well-nigh to death.
The most skilled physician in Damascus, Eliezer
by name, brought him back to life; but his
friends thought he had better let him die, for he
converted him to the hated Christian faith.
Persecuted by his kinsmen, he came to Antioch with
my brother and myself, that he might join the
great and flourishing Christian Church in that
city.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> While on a trading voyage to Smyrna, in
which we children accompanied our father, we
were captured by Illyrian pirates, and carried to
the slave market at Ravenna. There I was
purchased by a slave dealer from Rome, and my
father and brother were sold I know not whither.
I never saw them again,"&mdash;and she heaved a
weary and hopeless sigh.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said the Empress, a tear of
sympathy glistening on her cheek, "I fear that I
can give thee little help. 'Tis strange how my
heart went out toward thee when thou wert first
brought so tristful and forlorn into my presence.
'Tis a sad world, and even the Emperors can do
little to set it right."</p>

<p>"There is One who rules on high, dear lady,
the God of our fathers, by whom kings rule and
princes decree judgment. He doeth all things
well."</p>

<p>"Yes, child, I am not ignorant of the God of
the Jews and Christians. What a pity that there
should be such bitter hate on the part of your
countrymen towards those who worship the same
great God."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Callirhoë, "blindness in part hath
happened to Israel. If they but knew how Jesus
of Nazareth fulfils all the types and prophecies
of their own Scriptures, they would hail Him as
the true Messiah of whom Moses and the prophets
did write."</p>

<p>"Well, child, I will help thee to find thy father,
if possible, though I fear it will be a difficult
task. Ask me freely anything that I can do.
As my freedwoman, you will, of course, bear my
name with your own. Now send my slave Juba
to accompany me to the banquet-hall."</p>

<p>Callirhoë, or as we may now call her, after the
Roman usage, Valeria Callirhoë, fervently kissed
the outstretched hand of her august mistress and
gracefully retired.</p>

<p>It may excite some surprise to find such
generous sentiments and such gentle manners as
we have described attributed to the daughter of
a persecuting Emperor and the wife of a stern
Roman general. But reasons are not wanting to
justify this delineation. Both Valeria and her
mother Prisca, during their long residence at
Nicomedia, where the Emperor Diocletian had
established his court, became instructed in the
Christian religion by the bishop of that
important see. Indeed, Eusebius informs us that
among them there were many Christian converts,
both Prisca and Valeria, in the Imperial palace.
Diocletian and his truculent son-in-law, Galerius,
were bigoted pagans, and the mother of the latter
was a fanatical worshipper of the goddess Cybele.
The spread of Christianity even within the
precincts of the palace provoked her implacable
resentment, and she urged on her son to active
persecution. A council was therefore held in the
palace at Nicomedia, a joint edict for the
extirpation of Christianity was decreed, and the
magnificent Christian basilica was razed to the
ground. The very next day the edict was torn
from the public forum by an indignant Christian,
and the Imperial palace was almost entirely
destroyed by fire. The origin of this disaster is
unknown, but it was ascribed to the Christians,
and intensified the virulence of the persecution.
Diocletian proceeded to Rome to celebrate a
military triumph and to concert with his western
colleagues more vigorous methods of persecution.
It is at this period that the opening scenes of our
story take place.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE IMPERIAL BANQUET.</p>

<p class="dropcap">At the summons of Callirhoë a Nubian female
slave, Juba by name, an old family nurse,
skilled in the use of herbs and potions, made her
appearance. Her huge and snowy turban and
her bright-coloured dress strikingly contrasted
with her jet complexion and homely features.
Yet, as the personal attendant of the young
empress, it was her duty to accompany her mistress
to the banquet-hall, to stand behind her chair,
to adjust her robes, hold her fan, and obey her
every word or gesture. As she drew aside the
curtain of the apartment which shut out the
light and heat, two lictors who guarded the door
sprang to their feet and preceded the empress
through the marble corridor to the <i>triclinium</i>, or
banquet chamber. It was a family party, rather
than a state banquet, but neither Greeks nor
Romans practised a profuse hospitality nor held
large social or festive gatherings like those of
modern times. Their feasts were rather for the
intense epicurean pleasure of a favoured few than
for the rational enjoyment of a larger company.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Couches inlaid with ivory and decked with
cushions surrounded three sides of a hollow
square. On these the emperor and his male
guests reclined, each resting on his left arm.
On ivory chairs facing the open side of the
square sat the Empress Prisca (a majestic-looking
matron of somewhat grave aspect), Valeria,
and a lady of the court, each accompanied by
her female slave. The extreme ugliness of the
Nubian Juba acted as a foil for the striking
beauty of Valeria.</p>

<p>First of all, the guests were crowned with
wreaths of fair and fragrant flowers. Then
elegantly dressed slaves brought in, to the sound
of music, the different courses: first eggs dressed
with vinegar, olives and lettuce, like our salad;
then roast pheasants, peacocks' tongues and
thrushes, and the livers of capons steeped in
milk; next oysters brought alive from the distant
shores of Great Britain, and, reversing our
order, fish in great variety&mdash;one of the most
beautiful of these was the purple mullet&mdash;served
with high-seasoned condiments and sauces. Of
solid meats the favourite dish was a roast sucking
pig, elegantly garnished. Of vegetables they had
nothing corresponding to our potatoes, but,
instead, a profusion of mallows, lentils, truffles, and
mushrooms. The banquet wound up with figs,
olives, almonds, grapes, tarts and confections, and
apples&mdash;hence the phrase <i>ab ovo ad mala</i>.</p>

<p>After the first course the emperor poured out a
libation of Falernian wine, with the Greek
formula, "to the supreme God," watching eagerly
if his wife and daughter would do the same.
Lacking the courage to make a bold confession
of Christianity, and thinking, with a casuistry
that we shall not attempt to defend, that the
ambiguity of the expression excused the act, they
also, apparently to the great relief of the emperor,
poured out a libation and sipped a small quantity
of the wine. The emperor then drank to the
health of his wife and daughter, wishing the
latter many returns of the auspicious day they
had met to celebrate. Each of the guests also
made, according to his ability, a complimentary
speech, which the ladies acknowledged by a
gracious salutation. After the repast slaves
brought perfumed water and embroidered
napkins for the guests to wash their fingers, which
had been largely employed in the process of dining.</p>

<p>The most of the guests were sycophants and
satellites of the emperor, and in the intervals
between the courses employed their art in
flattering his vanity or fomenting his prejudices.
One of them, Semphronius by name, an old
fellow with a very bald and shiny head and a
very vivacious manner, made great pretensions
to the character of a philosopher or professor of
universal knowledge, and was ever ready, with a
great flow of often unmeaning words, to give a
theory or explanation of every conceivable
subject. Others were coarse and sensual-looking
<i>bon vivants</i>, who gave their attention chiefly to
the enjoyment of the good fare set before them.
Another sinister-looking fellow, with a disagreeable
cast in one eye and a nervous habit of
clenching his hand as if grasping his sword, was
Quintus Naso, the prefect of the city. He had
been a successful soldier, or rather butcher, in
the Pannonian wars, and was promoted to his
bad eminence of office on account of his truculent
severity. Of very different character, however,
was a young man of noble family, Adauctus by
name, who was present in his official character
as Treasurer of the Imperial Exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He
almost alone of the guests paid a courteous
attention to the high-born ladies of the party, to
whom he frequently addressed polite remarks
while the others were intent only in fawning on
the great source of power. He, also, alone of all
present, conspicuously refrained from pouring out
a libation&mdash;a circumstance which did not escape
the keen eye of the emperor. After interrupted
talk on general topics, in which the ladies took
part, the conversation drifted to public matters,
on which they were not expected to meddle.</p>

<p>"Well, Naso, how was the edict received?"
said the emperor to the prefect, as a splendid
roast peacock, with sadly despoiled plumage, was
removed.</p>

<p>"As every command of your divine Majesty
should be received," replied Naso, "with respectful
obedience. One rash fool, indeed, attempted
to tear it down from the rostra of the Forum,
like that mad wretch at Nicomedia; but he was
taken in the act. He expiates to-night his crime,
so soon as I shall have wrung from him the
names of his fanatical accomplices,"&mdash;and he
clenched his hands nervously, as though he were
himself applying the instruments of torture.</p>

<p>"And you know well how to do that," said the
emperor with a sneer, for, like all tyrants, he
despised and hated the instruments of his tyranny.</p>

<p>"You may well call them fanatics, good Naso,"
chimed in the would-be philosopher, Semphronius;
"a greater set of madmen the world never saw.
They believe that this Chrestus whom they
worship actually rose from the dead. Heard ever any
man such utter folly as that! Whereas I have
satisfied myself, from a study of the official
records, that he was only a Jewish thaumaturge and
conjuror, who used to work pretended miracles
by means of dupes and accomplices. And when,
for his sedition, he was put to death as the vilest
of felons, these accomplices stole his body and
gave out that he rose from the dead."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"I have heard," said Adauctus gravely, "that
the Romans took care to prevent such a trick as
that by placing a maniple of soldiers on guard at
His grave."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe they say so," went on the
unabashed Semphronius; "but if they did, the
dastards were either overpowered, or they all fell
asleep while his fellow-knaves stole his body
away."</p>

<p>"Come now, Semphronius," said the emperor,
"that is too improbable a story about a whole
maniple of soldiers. You and I know too well,
Naso, the Roman discipline to accept such an
absurd story as that."</p>

<p>"Oh, if your divine Majesty thinks it
improbable, I fully admit that it is so," the supple
sophist eagerly replied. "I am inclined to
identify this impostor and a kinsman of his who was
beheaded by the divine Herod with the Janus
and Jambres whose story is told in the sacred
books of the Jews. But it is evident, from the
identity of name of one of these with the god
Janus, that they merely borrowed the story from
the Roman mythology. This execrable
superstition, they say, was brought to Rome by two
brothers named Paulus and Simon Magus. They
both expiated their crimes, one in the
Mammertine Prison, the other without the Ostian Gate.
They say also that when Simon the magician
struck the prison wall, a well of water gushed
forth for some of their mystic rites; and that
when the head of Paulus was smitten off it
bounded three times on the ground, and at each
spot where it touched a well of water sprang up.
But these are stories that no sane man can
believe."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"I quite agree with you in that," said Adauctus.</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed?" exclaimed the Emperor;
"I am glad to know that so brave and trusted an
officer can say so."</p>

<p>"I believe, your Majesty, that half the stories
told about the Christians are calumnies that no
candid man can receive," continued the young
officer.</p>

<p>"You are a bold man to say so, for they have
few friends and many enemies at court," replied
Diocletian; "but we will soon extort their secrets
by this edict. Will we not, good Naso?"</p>

<p>"It will not be my fault if we do not, your
divine Majesty," replied that worthy, with a more
hideous leer than usual in his cruel eye.</p>

<p>"Another thing these fools of Christians
believe," interjected the garrulous philosopher, "is,
that when they die their souls shall live in some
blander clime, and breathe some more ethereal
air. 'Tis this that makes them seem to covet
martyrdom, as they call it, instead of, like all
sane men, shunning death."</p>

<p>"But do not your own poets," chimed in the
soft voice of Valeria, "speak of the Elysian fields
and the asphodel meadows where the spirits of
heroes walk, and of the bark of Charon, who
ferries them across the fatal Styx?"</p>

<p>"True, your most august Highness," replied
the pedant with grimace intended to be polite,
"but those fables are intended for the vulgar, and
not for the cultured classes, to which your
Imperial Highness belongs. Even the priests
themselves do not believe in the existence of the gods
at whose altars they minister; so that Cicero, you
will remember, said that 'he wondered how one
augur could look in the face of another without
laughing.'"</p>

<p>"I quite admit," remarked Adauctus, "that the
priests are often impostors, deceiving the people;
but our wisest philosophers&mdash;the thoughtful Pliny,
the profound Tacitus, the sage Seneca, and even
the eloquent Cicero whom you have quoted&mdash;teach
the probability if not the certainty of a
future state, where virtue shall be rewarded and
wickedness punished."</p>

<p>"What do they know about it any more than
any of us?" interrupted the truculent Naso, to
whom ethical themes were by no means familiar
or welcome. My creed is embodied in the words
of that clever fellow, Juvenal, that I used to learn
at school&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Esse aliquid manes, et subterranea regna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec pueri credunt, nisi qui nondum ære lavantur.'"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"What's the use of all this talk?" lisped a
languid-looking epicurean fop, who, sated with
dissipation, at twenty-five found life as empty as
a sucked orange. "We cannot alter fate. Life
is short; let us make the most of it. I'd like to
press its nectar into a single draught and have
done with it for ever. As the easy-going Horace
says, 'The same thing happens to us all. When
our name, sooner or later, has issued from the
fatal urn, we leave our woods, our villa, our
pleasant homes, and enter the bark which is to
bear us into eternal exile!'"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Here the Emperor made an impatient gesture,
to indicate that he was weary of this philosophic
discourse. At the signal the ladies rose and
retired. Adauctus also made his official duties
an excuse for leaving the table, where Diocletian
and his other guests lingered for hours in a
drunken symposium.</p>

<p>Thus we find that the very questions which
engage the agnostics and skeptics and pessimists
of the present age&mdash;the Mallocks, and Cliffords,
and Harrisons and their tribe&mdash;have agitated the
world from the very dawn of philosophy. Did
space permit, we might cite the theories of
Lucretius as a strange anticipation of the
development hypothesis. Indeed the writings of
Pyrrho, Porphyry and Celsus show us that the
universal tendency of human philosophy, unaided
by divine inspiration, is to utter skepticism.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"THE CHRISTIANS TO THE LIONS."</p>

<p class="dropcap">The progress of our story transports us, on
the day after the banquet described in our
last chapter, to the palace of the Prefect Naso,
on the Aventine. It was a large and pompous-looking
building, with a many-columned portico
and spacious gardens, both crowded with statuary,
the spoil of foreign cities, or the product of
degenerate Greek art&mdash;as offensive in design as
skilful in execution. The whole bore evidence
of the ostentation of vulgar wealth rather than
of judicious taste. A crowd of "clients" and
satellites of the great man were hanging round
the doors, eager to present some petition, proffer
some service, or to swell his idle retinue, like
jackals around a lion, hoping to pick up a living
as hangers-on of such a powerful and unscrupulous
dispenser of patronage. In the degenerate
days of the Empire, the civic officials especially
had always a swarm of needy dependents seeking
to fatten on the spoils of office. They were
supposed, in some way, to add to the dignity
of the consuls and prætors, as in later times
were the retainers of a mediæval baron. The
system of slavery had made all honest labour
opprobrious, and these idle, corrupt, and dangerous
parasites had to be kept in good humour by
lavish doles and constant amusements. "Bread
and the Circus," was their imperious demand,
and having these, they cared for nothing else.</p>

<p>On the morning in question there was
considerable excitement among this turbulent throng,
for the rumour was current that there was to
be an examination of certain prisoners accused
of the vile crime of Christianity; and there were
hopes that the criminals would supply fresh
victims for the games of the amphitheatre, which
for some time had languished for lack of suitable
material. The temper of the mob we may learn
by the remarks that reach our ears as we elbow
our way through.</p>

<p>"Ho, Davus! what's the news to-day?" asked
a cobbler with his leathern apron tucked up
about his waist, of a greasy-looking individual
who strutted about with much affectation of
dignity; "you have the run of his Excellency's
kitchen, and ought to know."</p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i> there, Samos?" (a nick-name meaning
Flat Nose). "Back to your den, you slave,
and don't meddle with gentlemen. <i>'Ne sutor,'</i>
you know the rest."</p>

<p>"Can't you see that the cook drove him out
with the basting ladle?" said Muscus, the stout-armed
blacksmith, himself a slave, and resenting
the insult to his class; and so the laugh was
turned against the hungry parasite.</p>

<p>"Here, good Max, you are on the guard, you
can tell us," went on the burly smith.</p>

<p>"News enough, as you'll soon find. There's
to be more hunting of the Christians for those
who like it. For my part, I don't."</p>

<p>"Why not," asked Burdo, the butcher, a truculent
looking fellow with a great knife in a sheath
at his girdle. "I'd like no better fun. I'd as
lief kill a Christian as kill a calf."</p>

<p>"It might suit your business," answered stout
Max, with a sneer, "but hunting women and
children is not a soldier's trade."</p>

<p>"O ho! that's the game that's a-foot!"
chuckled a withered little wretch with a hungry face
and cruel eyes, like a weasel. "Here's a chance
for an honest man who worships the old gods
to turn an honest penny."</p>

<p>"Honest man!" growled Max. "Diogenes
would want a good lantern to find one in Rome
to-day. He'd certainly never take thee for one.
Thy very face would convict thee of violating
all the laws in the Twelve Tables."</p>

<p>"Hunting the Christians, that's the game, is
it?" said an ill-dressed idler, blear-eyed and
besotted; "and pestilent vermin they are. I'd
like to see them all drowned in the Tiber like
so many rats."</p>

<p>"You are more likely to see them devoured
in the amphitheatre," said Bruto, a Herculean
gladiator. "The Prefect is going to give some
grand games on the Feast of Neptune. Our new
lions will have a chance to flesh their teeth in
the bodies of the Christians. The wretches
haven't the courage to fight, like the Dacian
prisoners, with us gladiators, nor even with the
beasts; but just let themselves be devoured like
sheep."</p>

<p>At this juncture a commotion was observed
about the door, and Naso, the Prefect, came forth
and looked haughtily around. Several clients
pressed forward with petitions, which he
carelessly handed unopened to his secretary, who
walked behind. He regarded with some interest
the elegantly-dressed and graceful youth who
glided through the throng and presented a scroll,
saying, as he did so&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is of much importance, your Excellency.
It is about the Christians."</p>

<p>"Follow me to the Forum," said the Prefect,
and our old acquaintance Isidorus, for it was
he, fell into the train of the great civic dignitary.
Arrived at the Basilica Julia, or great Court
of Justice, the Prefect beckoned to the young
Greek secretary, and entered a private ante-room.
Throwing himself into a bronze chair, and pointing
the Greek to a marble seat, he asked
abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, what is this you know about these
Christians?"</p>

<p>"Something of much importance to your
Excellency, and I hope to learn something still
more important."</p>

<p>"You shall be well paid if you do," said the
Prefect. "It is difficult to convict them of any
crime."</p>

<p>"I have secret sources of information, your
Excellency. In fact, I hope to bring you the
names of the ringleaders of the accursed sect."</p>

<p>"How so? Are you not the secretary of
Flaccus Sertorius?"</p>

<p>"I am, your Excellency, but he has no heart
in the work of this new edict. I would like
to see more zeal in the Emperor's service."</p>

<p>"I like not this Sertorius," said the Prefect,
half musing. "He affects too much what they
call the severe old Roman virtues to suit these
times. But how do you expect to learn the
secrets of these Christians?"</p>

<p>"By becoming one myself, your Excellency,
replied the Greek, with a sinister expression
in his eyes."</p>

<p>"By becoming one yourself!" exclaimed the
Prefect, in a tone of anger and surprise. Then
noting the wily expression of the supple Greek,
he added, "Oh! I see, by becoming a spy upon
their practices and a betrayer of their secrets.
Is that it?"</p>

<p>"We Greeks like not the words traitor and
spy," said the youth, with a faint blush, "but
to serve the Emperor and your Excellency we
would bear even that opprobrium."</p>

<p>"Well, you look capable of it," said the
Prefect, with an undisguised sneer, "and I will
gladly use any instruments to crush this vile
sect."</p>

<p>"But, your Excellency," said the cringing
Greek, swallowing his chagrin and annoyance,
"I shall require gold to gain the confidence of
these Christians&mdash;not to bribe them, for that
is impossible, but to spend in what they call
charity&mdash;to give to their sick and poor."</p>

<p>"Not forgetting yourself, I'll be bound," sneered
the Prefect. "But what you say is no doubt
true;" and turning to the table he wrote an
order upon the Imperial Exchequer, and handed
it to the Greek, with the words, "If you make
good use of that, there is more where it comes
from. The Emperor pays his <i>faithful</i> servants
well." Then dismissing the treacherous tool
whom he himself despised, he passed into the
Basilica, or court, where the bold Christian youth
who had torn down the Emperor's edict was
to receive his sentence.</p>

<p>Livid with the torture he had undergone to
make him disclose the names of his accomplices
&mdash;tortures which he had borne with heroic
fortitude he boldly avowed his act, and defied the
power of the Prefect to extort the name of a
single Christian from his lips. We will not
harrow the hearts of our readers by recounting
the atrocious tortures by which the body of the
brave youth had been wrung. He was at length
borne away fainting to his cruel fate. Although
the Prefect, who had sworn to have his secret
if he tore the heart out of his body, gnashed
his teeth in impotent rage at the defiance of
the mangled martyr, yet he could not in his
inmost soul help feeling the vast gulf between
his sublime fidelity and the heinous guilt of the
base traitor from whom he had just parted.</p>

<p>The pages of the contemporary historians,
Eusebius and Lactantius, give too minute and
circumstantial accounts of the persecutions, of
which they were eye-witnesses, to allow us to
adopt the complacent theory of Gibbon, that
the sufferings of the Christians were
comparatively few and insignificant. "We ourselves
have seen," says the Bishop of Cæsarea, "crowds
of persons, some beheaded, others burned alive
in a single day, so that the murderous weapons
were blunted and broken to pieces, and the
executioners, weary with slaughter, were obliged to
give over the work of blood.... They vied
with each other," he continues, "in inventing
new tortures, as if there were prizes offered to
him who should contrive the greatest cruelties."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Men whose only crime was their religion, were
scourged with chains laden with bronze balls,
till the flesh hung in shreds, and even the bones
were broken. They were bound in fetters of
red hot iron, and roasted over fires so slow
that they lingered for hours, or even days, in
their mortal agony; their flesh was scraped from
the very bone with ragged shells, or lacerated
with burning pincers, iron hooks, and instruments
with horrid teeth and claws, hence called <i>ungulæ</i>,
examples of which have been found in the
Catacombs; molten metal was applied to their bodies
till they became one undistinguishable wound,
and mingled salt and vinegar,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or unslacked
lime, were rubbed upon the quivering flesh, torn
and bleeding from the rack or scourge&mdash;tortures
more inhuman than savage Indian ever wreaked
upon his mortal foe. Chaste matrons and tender
virgins were given over to a fate a thousand-fold
worse than death, and were subjected to indignities
too horrible for words to utter. And all
these sufferings were endured, often with joy and
exultation, for the love of a Divine Master, when
a single word, a grain of incense cast upon the
heathen altar, would have released the victims
from their agonies. No lapse of time, and no
recoil from the idolatrous homage paid in after
ages to the martyr's relics, should impair in
our hearts the profound and rational reverence
with which we bend before his tomb.</p>

<p>While the examination of the Christian martyr
was in progress, much interest was manifested
in his fate by the throng of idlers who were
wont to linger around the public courts, to gratify
their curiosity or their morbid love of cruelty.</p>

<p>"The State is in danger," said Piso, the barber,
gesticulating violently, "if such miscreants are
suffered to live."</p>

<p>"Ay, is it," chimed in a garrulous pedagogue,
"this is rank treason."</p>

<p>"Right, neighbour Probus," added a
pettifogging lawyer. "This is the very <i>crimen
majestatis</i>. These men are the enemies of Cæsar
and of the Roman people."</p>

<p>"Who would think he was so wicked?" said
a poor freed-woman who sold sugar barley in
the Forum. "Sure he looks innocent enough."</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> innocent," replied her neighbour, who
kept a stall for the sale of figs and olives. "'Tis
that wretch who is wicked," looking fiercely at
the Prefect as he moved from the court.</p>

<p>"You are right," said a grave-looking man,
speaking low, but with a look of secret
understanding; "but be careful. You can do the
brave Lucius no good, and may betray the others
into jeopardy," and he passed swiftly through
the throng.</p>

<p>"'Tis time all these Atheists were exterminated,"
said Furbo, a sort of hanger-on at the
neighbouring temple of Saturn. "The gods are
angry, and the victims give sinister auspices.
To-day when the priest slew the ram for the
sacrifice, would you believe it? it had no heart;
and the sacred chickens refused their food."</p>

<p>"And they certainly are to blame for the
floods of the Tiber, which destroyed all the
olives and lentils in my shop," said Fronto, the
oil and vegetable seller.</p>

<p>"And the rain rusted all the wheat on our
farm," said Macer, the villicus or land-steward.</p>

<p>"And the fever has broken out afresh in the
Suburra," croaked a withered old Egyptian crone,
like a living mummy, who told fortunes and sold
spells in that crowded and pest-smitten quarter,
where the poor swarmed like flies.</p>

<p>"And the drought has blighted all the vines,"
echoed Demetrius, the wine-merchant.</p>

<p>"I never knew trade so dull," whined Ephraim,
the Jewish money-lender. "We'll never have
good times again till these accursed Christians
are all destroyed."</p>

<p>"So say I," "And I," "And I," shouted one
after another of the mob, till the wild cry rang
round the Forum, <i>"Christiani adleones"</i>&mdash;"The
Christians to the lions."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="center">THE MARTYR'S BURIAL.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The fawning Greek Isidorus had stealthily
wormed his way into the confidence of
Faustus, a servant of Adauctus, by professing
to be, if not a Christian, at least a sincere
inquirer after the truth, and an ardent hater
of the edict of persecution. Faustus had therefore
promised to conduct him to a private meeting
of the Christians, where he might be more
fully instructed by the good presbyter, Primitius.
In the short summer twilight they therefore
made their way to the villa of the Christian
matron Marcella, on the Appian Way, about two
miles from the city gates. A high wall
surrounded the grounds. In this was a wicket or
door, at which Faustus knocked. The white-haired
porter partly opened the door, and recognizing
the foremost figure, admitted him, but
gave a look of inquiry before passing his
companion.</p>

<p>"It is all right," said Faustus. "He is a good
friend of mine," and so they passed on.</p>

<p>The grounds were large and elegant, fountains
flashed in the soft moonlight, the night-blooming
cereus breathed forth its rare perfume, and
masses of cypress and ilex cast deep shadows
on the pleached alleys. But there was a conspicuous
absence of the garden statuary invariably
found in pagan grounds. There was no
figure of the god Terminus, nor of the beautiful
Flora, or Pomona, nor of any of the fair goddesses
which to-day people the galleries of Rome.
In the spacious <i>atrium</i>, or central apartment of
the house, which was partially lighted by bronze
candalabra, was gathered a company of nearly
a hundred persons, seated on couches around
the hall&mdash;the men on the right and the women
on the left. A solemn stillness brooded over
the entire assembly. Near a tall cadalabrum
stood a venerable figure with a snowy beard&mdash;the presbyter Primitius. From a parchment
scroll in his hand he read in impressive tones
the holy words of hope and consolation, "Let
not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God,
believe also in me," and the rest of that sweet,
parting counsel of the world's Redeemer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/valeriamartyrofc00withiala_0062.png" width="257" height="400" alt="Stairway To Catacomb." />
<span class="caption">Stairway To Catacomb.</span>
</div>

<p>Before he was through, a procession with
torches was seen approaching through the garden.
On a bier, borne by four young men, lay the
body of Lucius the martyr, wrapped in white
and strewn with flowers&mdash;at rest in the solemn
majesty of death from the tortures of the rack
and scourge. The little assembly within joined
the procession without, and softly singing the
holy words which still give such consolation
to the stricken heart, "Beati sunt mortui qui
in Domino morientur&mdash;Blessed are the dead who
die in the Lord," through the shadowy cypress
alleys wound the solemn procession. Soon it
reached an archway, like that shown in our <a href="#CHAPTER_I">first
chapter</a>, the entrance to the catacomb of St.
Callixtus, which lay beneath the grounds of the
Lady Marcella. Then, preceded by torches, with
careful tread the bearers of the bier slowly descended
a rock-hewn stairway, and traversed a
long and gloomy corridor, lined on either side
with the graves of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This stairway
and corridor are shown in the engravings which
accompany this chapter.</p>

<p>An almost supernatural fear fell upon the soul
of Isidorus the Greek, who had followed in the
train of the procession, as it penetrated further
and further into the very heart of the earth.
He seemed like Ulysses with his ghostly guide
visiting the grim regions of the nether-world,
and the words of the classic poet came to his
mind, "Horror on all sides, the very silence fills
the soul with dread." Already for more than
two centuries these gloomy galleries had been
the receptacles of the Christian dead, and in
many places the slabs that sealed the tombs were
broken, and the graves yawned weirdly as he
passed, revealing the unfleshed skeletons lying
on their stony bed. To his excited imagination
they seemed to menace him with their outstretched
bony arms. Deep, mysterious shadows
crouched around, full of vague suggestions of
affright. His gay, joyous and pleasure-loving
nature recoiled from the evidences of mortality
around him. His footsteps faltered, and he
almost fell to the rocky pavement.
The procession swept on, the glimmering lights growing
dimmer and dimmer, and then turning an angle
they suddenly disappeared. Fear lent wings to
his feet, and he fled along the narrow path
with outstretched hands, sometimes touching with
a feeling of horrible recoil the bones or ashes
of the dead. He hurried along, groping from
side to side, and when he reached the passage
down which the funeral procession had disappeared,
no gleam of it was visible, nor could
he tell, so suddenly the lights had disappeared,
whether it had turned to the right or to the left.
The darkness was intense&mdash;a darkness that might
be felt, a brooding horror that oppressed every
sense. He tried to call out, but his tongue
seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth, and
his faint cry was swallowed up in the deep and
oppressive silence. Had the vengeance of the
gods overtaken him in punishment for his meditated
crime? Was he, who so loved the light
and air, and joyous sunshine, never to behold
them again? Must he be buried in these gloomy
vaults for ever? These thoughts surged through
his brain, and almost drove him wild. But
what sounds are those that steal faintly on his
ear? They seem like the music of heaven heard
in the heart of hell. Stronger, sweeter, clearer,
come the holy voices. And now they shape
themselves to words, "Nam et si ambulavero in
medio umbræ mortis, non timebo mala&mdash;Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil." Was it to taunt
his terrors those strange words were sung? Then
the holy chant went on, "Quonian tu mecum es
Virga tua, et baculus tuus, ipsa me consolata
sunt&mdash;For thou art with me, thy rod and thy
staff they comfort me." What strange secret had
these Christians that sustained their souls even
surrounded by the horrors of the tomb?</p>

</div>

<p>Isidorus groped his way amid the gloom toward
these heavenly sounds. Soon he caught a faint
glimmer of light reflected from an angle of the
corridor, and then a ray through an open doorway
pierced the gloom. Hurrying forward he found
the whole company from which he had become
separated gathered in a sort of chapel hewn out
of the solid rock. The body of Lucius lay upon
the bier before an open tomb, hewn out of the
wall. The venerable presbyter, by the fitful
torchlight which illumined the strange group, and
lit up the pious paintings and epitaphs upon the
wall, read from a scroll the strange words, "And
I saw under the altar the souls of them that
were slain for the Word of God and for the
testimony which they held, and they cried with
a loud voice, saying, How long, Lord, holy
and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our
blood on them that dwell on the earth?" A
great fear fell upon the soul of the susceptible
Greek, for the slain man seemed, in the solemn
majesty of death, to become an accusing judge.</p>

<p>Then turning his scroll the presbyter read on,
"What are these arrayed in white robes and
whence came they? These are they which came
out of great tribulation, and have washed their
robes and made them white in the blood of
the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne
of God, and serve Him day and night in His
temple.... They shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more ... and God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes."</p>

<p>These holy words stirred strange emotions in
the agitated breast of the young Greek. Sweeter
were they than ought he had ever read in
Pindar's page, and more sublime than even
Homer's hymns. If these things were true, he
thought, he would gladly change places with the
martyr on his bier, if only he might exchange
the torturing ambitions, strifes and sins of time
for the holy joys which that marvellous scroll
revealed.</p>

<p>Then by loving hands the martyr's body was
placed in its narrow tomb. A marble slab, on
which were simply written his name and the
words, "DORMIT IN PACE&mdash;He sleeps in peace,"
was cemented against the opening. With a
trowel, a palm branch, the symbol of martyrdom,
was rudely traced in the yet unhardened cement,
and the little company began to disperse.</p>

<p>"O sir," cried the young Greek, clasping the
hand of the venerable Primitius, "teach me more
fully this excellent way."</p>

<p>"Gladly, my son," replied the benignant old
man. "Come hither to-morrow. For here," he
added with a smile, "my friends insist that I
must remain concealed till this outburst of
persecution shall have passed.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Hilarus, the fossor,
will be thy guide. He will now conduct thee
back to thy friend Faustus, who is seeking thee."</p>

<p>By the dim light of a waxen taper which he
carried, Hilarus led the Greek to the entrance
to the Catacomb, where they found Faustus waiting
in some alarm at the delay of his friend.
In the bright moonlight they walked back to
the city. Isidorus thought well to evade giving
an account of his adventure in the Catacomb,
and, to turn the conversation, asked how the
Christians had obtained the body of Lucius from
the public executioner.</p>

<p>"Oh, money will do anything in Rome," said
Faustus, at which the Greek visibly winced.
"The Lady Marcella, in whose grounds the Catacomb
is, devotes much of her wealth to burying
the poor of the Church, and her steward had
no difficulty in purchasing from Hanno, the executioner,
the mangled remains of the martyr.
'Tis like, before long, that he will have many
such to sell."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">WITH HILARUS THE FOSSOR.</p>

<p class="dropcap">"No one becomes vile all at once," said the
Roman moralist, and we would be unjust to
the fickle, fawning Greek Isidorus, if we concluded
that deliberate treachery was his purpose, as, at
the invitation of Primitius, he repaired next day
to the catacomb of St. Calixtus. His was a susceptible,
impressionable nature, easily influenced
by its environment, like certain substances that
acquire the odour, fragrant or foul, of the atmosphere
by which they are surrounded. Amid the
vileness of the Roman court, his better feelings
died, and he was willing to become the minion of
tyranny, or the tool of treachery. Amid the holy
influences of the Christian assembly, some chord
responded, like an Eolian harp, to the breathings
of the airs from heaven. It was, therefore, with
strangely conflicting feelings, that he passed
beneath the Capuan Gate, and along the Appian
Way, toward the Villa Marcella. His better
nature recoiled from his purposed treachery of
the previous day. His heart yearned to know
more of that strange power which sustained the
Christian martyr in the presence of torture and
of death.</p>

<p>He was recognized by the porter at the gate of
the villa as the companion of Faustus, and on his
inquiry for the house of Hilarus, the fossor, was
directed to a low-walled, tile-roofed building, such
as may be seen in many parts of the Campagna
to the present day. About the house were many
stone chippings, and numerous slabs of marble.
Under a sort of arbour, covered with vine branches
in full leaf, stood a grisly-visaged man, with
close-cropped, iron-gray hair, chipping with
mallet and chisel at a large sarcophagus, or stone
coffin, upon a mason's bench.</p>

<p>"Do I address Hilarus, the fossor?" asked the
Greek, with a graceful salutation.</p>

<p>"I am Hilarus, at your service, noble sir,"
replied the old man, with a kindly expression of
countenance.</p>

<p>The young Greek then told of the invitation
given him by the good presbyter, Primitius, and
requested to be conducted to him.</p>

<p>"You are, of course, known to the porter, or
you would not have obtained admission to these
grounds," said Hilarus. "But you will first honour
my poor roof by partaking some refreshment after
your hot walk from the city."</p>

<p>"Thanks, good friend," replied the Greek, "a
draught of your native wine would not be amiss.
Nay, I would prefer it here beneath the grateful
shadow of this vine," he continued, as Hilarus
courteously led the way to the open door of the
cottage. This was quite small, and had almost
no furniture save some earthen pots for cooking
at an open fireplace. In a moment the old man
re-appeared with an earthen flagon of wine and a
bronze salver, with bread and goat's milk cheese,
and a bronze cup.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>"For whom is this elegant sarcophagus?" asked
Isidorus, as he sipped his wine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">Sarcophagus now in Lateran Museum.</span>
</div>

<p>"I pray it be not for her who orders it," said
the old man, devoutly; "at least not for many a
long day to come. The good Lady Marcella bade
me exercise my best skill in setting forth the
great truths of the Gospel, that in death as in
life, she said, she might teach the doctrines of
Christ. She often comes to see how I get on
with it, and to describe how she wishes it to be.
See," said the old man,
pointing to the side&mdash;(see
above)&mdash;"the general idea is all
her own, the details
only are mine. These
four groups exhibit
four scenes in the life&mdash;or
rather in the
death&mdash;of our Lord.
To the extreme right
we see Pilate, warned
by his wife, washing
his hands and saying
'I am innocent of the
blood of this just person,'
and yet, like a
coward, consenting to
His death, he was as
guilty as Judas, who
betrayed Him."</p>

<p>At this the Greek visibly winced, then paled
and flushed, and said, "Well, what is the next
group?"</p>

<p>"That is part of the same," said the sculptor,
with evident pride in his work. "It represents
our Lord, guarded by a Roman soldier, witnessing
a good confession before Pontius Pilate. In the
central niche are two soldiers, types of the Christian
warriors, whose only place of safety is beneath
the cross; while above are the wreath of victory,
the doves of peace, and the sacred monogram,
made up, I need not tell you, who are a Greek,
of the two first letters of the word Christos. To
the left you observe a Roman soldier, putting on
Jesus the crown of thorns, and in the last, Simon
the Cyrenian, guarded by a soldier, bearing His
cross."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>"And for whom are all these funeral tablets,"
said Isidorus, pointing to a number of slabs partly
executed&mdash;some with the engraved outline of a
dove, or fish, or anchor, or olive branch upon
them&mdash;leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>"For whom God pleases," said the old man,
devoutly. "I keep them ready to suit purchasers,
and then I have only to fill the name and age, or
date."</p>

<p>"But see here," said the Greek, touching with
his foot one on which were effigies of Castor and
Pollux, the "great twin brethren" of the Roman
mythology, and the letters, "<span class="smcap">Dis Manibvs</span>&mdash;To
the Divine Spirits;" "this is a pagan inscription.
How come you to use that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we turn up such slabs by scores, in
ploughing the fields hereabout. They may be
hundreds of years old, for aught I know. We
just turn that side to the wall, or deface it with
a few strokes of the chisel."</p>

<p>"It was a prentice hand that made <i>that</i>, I'll
be bound," said the Greek, pointing to one on
which was rudely painted in black pigment, the
sprawling inscription that follows, no two letters
being the same size&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">LOcvSaVgvStIsvToRis.</span><br />
"The Place of Augustus, the Shoemaker."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is the epitaph of a poor cobbler. I
let my boys do that for nothing. They will soon
be able to do better. Here now is one by my
oldest son, of which I would not be ashamed
myself;" and he pointed to a neatly-cut inscription,
the letters coloured with a bright vermillion
pigment, which ran thus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="bbox">AVRELIAE THEVDOSIAE<br />
BENIGNISSIMAE ET INCOMPARABILI FEMINAE<br />
AVRELIVS OPTATVS<br />
CONIVGE INNOCENTISSIMAE</p>

<p class="center">"Aurelius Optatus, to his most innocent wife, Aurelia<br />
Theudosia, a most gracious and incomparable woman."</p>

<p>"We will now, if you are sufficiently cool,"
he went on, "enter the catacomb. It is not well
to make too sudden a transition from this sultry
heat to their chilly depths."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the young man, "I shall find
the change from this sultry air, I doubt not, very
agreeable;" and they crossed a vineyard under a
blazing sun, that made the cool crypts exceedingly
grateful. Descending the stairway, the guide took
from a niche a small terra-cotta lamp, which he
carefully trimmed and lit at another, which was
always kept burning there.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>"Is there not danger of losing one's way in
this labyrinth?" asked the Greek, feeling no
small degree of the terror of his late adventure
returning.</p>

<p>"Very great danger, indeed," replied Hilarus,
"unless you know the clue and marks by which
we steer, almost like ships at sea. But knowing
these, the way may become as familiar as the
streets of Rome. You may, perhaps, have heard
of Cæcilia, a blind girl, who acted as guide to
these subterranean places of assembly, because to
her accustomed feet the path was as easy as the
Appian Way to those who see."</p>

<p>"How many Greek epitaphs there are," said
Isidorus, deeply interested in scanning the
inscriptions as he passed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the fossor, "there are a-many of
your countryfolk buried here; and even some
who are not like to have their epitaphs written
in the language in which holy Paulus wrote his
epistle to the Church in Rome."</p>

<p>"But what wretched scrawls the most of them
are," said the Greek, with something like a sneer;
"and see, here is one even upside down."</p>

<p>"Yes, noble sir," continued the old man, "not
many mighty, not many noble are called&mdash;most
of those who sleep around us are God's great
family of the poor. Indeed, most of them were
slaves. That poor fellow was a martyr in the
last persecution. I mind it well, though it is
years agone. We buried him by stealth at dead
of night, and did not notice that the hastily
written inscription was reversed."</p>

<p>The dim rays of their lamp and taper made
but a faint ring of light about their feet. Their
steps, as they walked over the rocky floor, echoed
strangely down the long-drawn corridors and hollow
vaults, dying gradually away in the solemn
stillness of this valley of the shadow of death.
The sudden transition from the brilliant Italian
sunlight to this sepulchral gloom, from the busy
city of the living to this silent city of the dead,
smote the heart of the susceptible youth with a
feeling of awe. And all around in this vast
necropolis, each in his narrow cell forever laid, were
unnumbered thousands, who were once like himself,
full of energy and life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

Chambers, Showing Light and air Shaft" />
<span class="caption">Sectional View of Gallery and
Chambers, Showing Light and air Shaft</span>
</div>

<p>As they advanced, a faint light in the distance
seemed to penetrate the gloom. It grew brighter
as they approached, and attracted by the sound
of the footsteps, a venerable figure emerged from
a doorway and stood in the flood of light which
poured down from an opening in the vaulted
roof, which extended to the bright free air above.
Almost like an apparition from the other world,
in the strong, Rembrandt-like illumination in
which he stood, looked the venerable Primitius,
clothed in white, with silvery hair and flowing
beard, and high, bare brow. As Isidorus glanced
up the shaft, he saw the blue sky shining far
above, and the waving of the long grass that
fringed the opening for light and air. This
construction&mdash;a very frequent one in the Catacombs&mdash;is
shown in sectional view on the previous page.
On each side of the corridor was a chamber about
twelve feet square, also lit up by this shaft,
which, plastered with white stucco, reflected the
light into every part.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my son," said the venerable presbyter,
as he sat down on a bench hewn out of
the dry pummice-like rock "Welcome to these
abodes of death; may they prove to thee the
birthplace to eternal life;" and he laid his hand
benignantly on the head of the young man, whom
he had motioned to a seat beside him.</p>

<p>"Sire," said the youth, all the nobler feelings
of his nature deeply moved, "I wish above all
things to sit at your feet and to learn the lessons
of wisdom which you are so well able to impart
But are these seemly surroundings for a man of
your years and condition?&mdash;this rocky vault, this
utter loneliness, and these crumbling relics of
mortality?" and he shuddered as he glanced at
the shattered sepulchral slabs, which revealed the
remains of what was once man in his strength,
woman in her beauty, or a sweet child in its
innocence and glee.</p>

<p>"Why not, my son? soon I must lie down
with them and be at rest. The thought has no
terrors to my soul I know no loneliness, and
through the care of kind friends my wants are
all supplied. But your young blood and sensitive
imagination, I perceive, shrink from these
things to which, by long use, I have become
accustomed. Let us go into the adjoining chamber,
which you will find more cheerful, and, I trust,
not less instructive."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">WITH PRIMITIUS, THE PRESBYTER.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The venerable presbyter laid his hand familiarly
on the young man's shoulder and
conducted him into a smaller, but much more elegantly
finished, apartment. It contained no graves, save
an arched tomb which had never been used; at one
side was a shelf for lamps. The whole surface
of the wall was covered with hard white stucco,
which was divided into panels by bands and
borders of brilliant red and blue, as shown in
the cut on next page. The vaulted ceiling was
similarly divided. The angles were filled in with
elegant floral designs, and the panels with Biblical
and symbolical paintings, which Primitius
began now to explain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/valeriamartyrofc00withiala_0084.png" width="400" height="325" alt="Painted Chamber in the Catacombs" />
<span class="caption">Painted Chamber in the Catacombs</span>
</div>

<p>"Thou seest, my son," he said, "that central
group above the arch. That represents the Good
Shepherd who gave His life for the sheep. Thou
perceivest He bears the lost sheep upon His
shoulders, and gently leads those which follow
Him. Even so, all we, like sheep, have gone
astray, but the blessed Saviour seeks the erring,
and brings them into the safe and true fold.
Thou seest to the left the figure between the
two lions. That is Daniel in the lion's den; and
to the right are the three Hebrews in the fiery
furnace. These, my son, are symbols of the
Church of Christ, amid the wild beasts and the
fires of persecutions. But she shall be delivered
unhurt; she shall come forth unscathed. In the
ceiling you will observe praying figures between
lambs, the emblems of the Church, the Bride
which is the Lamb's wife, perpetually engaged
in adoration and prayer."</p>

<p>The youth was deeply impressed, and almost
awed, to see the silvery-haired old man, a refugee
from persecution, in these subterranean crypts,
with the full assurance of faith, confronting all
the power of the persecuting despot of the world,
and predicting the triumph of that oppressed
Church which was compelled to seek safety in
those dens and caves of the earth.</p>

<p>The good old man then sought to impart the
great truths of our holy religion to his new
catechumen, and to implant in his soul the same
germs of lofty faith that flourished in his own.
With this object he led him through the long
corridors and chambers of the vast encampment
of death&mdash;a sort of whispering gallery of the
past, eloquent with the expression of the faith
and hope of the silent sleepers in their narrow
cells.</p>

<p>"Listen, my son," said Primitius, "to the
testimony of the dead in Christ, and of the martyrs
for the truth," and pausing from time to time
before some inscribed or painted slab, he pointed
out the lofty hopes which sustained their souls
in the very presence of death.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, entering again the chamber
he had first left, "is the sepulchre of my own
beloved wife. When depressed and lonely, I
come hither and derive strength and consolation
by reading the words which she requested, with
her dying breath, should be written on her tomb,"
and with deep emotion he traced with his finger
the inscription:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p class="center">PARCITE VOS LACRIMIS DVLCIS CVM CONIVGE NATAE<br />
VIVENTEMQVE DEO CREDITE FLERE NEFAS.<br /><br />

"Refrain from tears, my sweet children and husband,<br />
and believe that it is forbidden to weep for one who lives<br />
in God."</p>

<p>"And here," he went on, "is the tomb of our
little child," and Isidorus read with softened
spirit the words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AGNELLVS DEI&mdash;PARVM STETIT APVD NOS ET<br />
PRAECESSIT NOS IN PACE.<br /><br />

"God's little lamb&mdash;he stayed but a short time with<br />
us, and went before us in peace."</p>

<p>"And here," said Primitius, "is the couch of
our eldest daughter," and he read, with caressing
tones, her epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANIMA DVLCIS INNOCVA SAPIENS ET PVLCHRA&mdash;<br />
NON MORTVA SED DATA SOMNO.<br /><br />

"A sweet spirit, guileless, wise, beautiful. She is not<br />
dead but sleepeth."</p>

<p>"This is certainly very different," said Isidorus,
"from two epitaphs I read to-day upon the pagan
tombs on the Appian Way. They ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">DECIPIMVR VOTIS ET TEMPORE FALLIMVR ET MORS<br />
DERIDET CVRAS ANXIA VITA NIHIL.<br /><br />

"We are deceived by our vows, misled by time, and<br />
death derides our cares; anxious life is naught."</p>

<p class="center">INFANTI DVLCISSIMO QVEM DEI IRATI AETERNO<br />
SOMNO DEDERVNT.<br /><br />

"To a very sweet child, whom the angry gods gave to<br />
eternal sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Primitius, "nothing can sustain the
soul in the presence of death, but such faith as
that of my friend Eutuchius, who sleeps here;"
and he read the lofty line:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">IN CHRISTVM CREDENS PREMIA LVCIS HABET.<br /><br />

"Believing in Christ, he has the rewards of the light<br />
(of heaven)."</p>

<p>"Similar are these also," and he pointed to the
following ill-written, but sublime, epitaphs, which
Isidorus slowly spelled out:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">DVLCIS ET INNOCES <i>(sic)</i> HIC DORMIT SEVERIANVS<br />
SOMNO PACIS CVIVS SPIRITVS IN LVCE DOMINI<br />
SVSCEPTVS EST,&mdash;IN SEMPETERNALE<br />
AEVVM QVIESCIT SECVRVS.<br /><br />

"Here lies in the sleep of peace, the sweet and<br />
innocent Severianus, whose spirit is received into the<br />
light of God. He rests free from care throughout<br />
endless time."</p>

<p>"But how were these Christians so confident
of the future life," asked the Greek, "when the
greatest of the philosophers and sages&mdash;a Socrates
or Cicero&mdash;never rose above a vague 'perhaps,'
and even the philosophic Pliny, anticipating only
annihilation, writes, 'there is no more consciousness
after death than before birth?'"</p>

<p>"Find there thy answer, young man," exclaimed
Primitius, and with a gleam of exultation in his
eyes, he pointed to the following epitaphs:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CREDO QVIA REDEMPTOR MEVS VIVIT ET NOVISSIMO<br />
DIE DE TERRA SVSCITABIT ME IN CARNE MEA<br />
VIDEBO DOMINVM.<br /><br />

"I believe, because that my Redeemer liveth, and in<br />
the last day shall raise me from the earth, that in my<br />
flesh I shall see the Lord."</p>

<p class="center">HIC REQVIESCIT CARO MEA NOVISSIMO VERO DIE<br />
PER CHRISTVM CREDO RECVSCITABITVR A MORTVIS.<br /><br />

"Here rests my flesh, but at the last day, through<br />
Christ, I believe it will be raised from the dead."</p>

<p>"And must the soul, then, slumber with the
body in blank unconsciousness till this 'last
day?'" asked the Greek. "Methinks I should
shudder at going out into the dark inane, like
a taper extinguished in these gloomy vaults.
Better is the dim and ghostly Hades, and Elysian
Fields of our own mythology, than that."</p>

<p>"Not so, my son," replied Primitius, "we
believe with the blessed Paul&mdash;that as soon as the
soul passes from earth's living death, it enters into
the undying life and unfading bliss of heaven."
And he pointed out, one after another, the
following epitaphs corroborating his view:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CORPVS HABET TELLVS ANIMAM CAELESTIA REGNA.<br />
MENS NESCIA MORTIS VIVIT ET ASPECTV<br />
FBVITVR BENE CONSCIA CHRISTI.<br /><br />

"The soul lives unknowing of death, and consciously
rejoices in the vision of Christ."</p>

<p class="center">PRIMA VIVIS IN GLORIA DEI ET IN PACE DOMINI
NOSTRI XR.<br /><br />

"Prima, thou livest in the glory of God, and in the
peace of Christ our Lord."</p>

<p>"This is indeed a high philosophy, beyond
aught I ever heard before," said Isidorus, deeply
moved. "Whence do you Christians derive such
lofty teachings? For as Hilarus but now said
most of your sect are poor and lowly in this
world's goods and rank."</p>

<p>"Our teaching comes, my son, from God Himself,
the Great Father of lights, and from Jesus
Christ our Lord. Behold, as the greatest favour
I can do thee, I will lend thee this precious MS.
of the Gospel of the blessed John;" and he took
from a leathern case a purple vellum parchment
scroll, inscribed with letters of silver. "Cherish
it carefully; 'tis worth more than gold. When
thou hast well pondered it, I will lend thee the
letter of the blessed Paul to the infant Church
in this city of Home. But here comes Hilarus
to conduct thee back to the light of day. Return
hither, if thou canst, on the fourth day from now
&mdash;the day of our Sabbath assembly. My blessing
be upon thee. <i>Pax vobiscum et cum spiritu tuo.</i>"</p>

<p>The young Greek knelt at the old man's feet,
then rose and kissed his hand, and followed in
silence the fossor Hilarus. At length he broke
the silence by inquiring,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the meaning, good Hilarus, of all
these strange figures which I have noted on the
tombstones as I passed. I have observed a lion,
a pig, an ass, a cobbler's last, carpenters', masons',
and wool-combers' implements; a fish, a ship, an
anchor, and the like&mdash;all scratched or painted on
the stone slabs. They have no religious
significance, surely?"</p>

<div><div class="captiontitle">Tomb Of The Bishops, Catacomb Of St. Calixtus.</div><br /><br />

Seven of the Bishops of the early Christian Church in Rome fell in
succession by the hand of the headsman, five of them in the space of
eight years. In this chamber are buried several of those heroic martyrs
of Jesus.</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, no, not all of them," said Hilarus, with
a smile. "You see, many of the Christians being
lowly craftsmen, are unable to read, so the tools
or emblems of their calling are inscribed on the
tombs of their friends, that they may recognize
and find them again in this vast cemetery."</p>

<p>"But the ship, anchor, and fish are not signs of
a handicraft, unless that of sailor or fisherman."</p>

<p>"No, <a name="the_fish" id="the_fish">the fish</a> has another and a secret meaning.
I need not tell a scholar like you, that the first
letters of the Greek names for Jesus Christ, Son
of God, the Saviour, make up the word Ichthus,
or fish, so it is used as a secret symbol of our
faith. The ship is the emblem, I have been told,
even in your own country, of a well-spent life,
and to us it signifies a soul entering into the
haven of eternal rest. While our holy hopes are
the anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast,
entering into that within the veil."</p>

<p>"Well, and the lion, ass, and pig? What about
them?"</p>

<p>"These," said the fossor, with a laugh, which
seemed as incongruous to him as it would be
to a modern sexton, for such his office virtually
was, "these are a sort of play upon the names
of Leo, Onager, and Porcella, the latter was a
sort of pet name, I suspect&mdash;'Little Pig'&mdash;by
which their friends, who could not read, could
find their tombs."</p>

<p>"What wives these Christians must have had,"
continued the keenly-observing Greek. "I have
noticed several inscriptions, in which they are
said to have passed ten, twenty, thirty, and one
even fifty years of married life&mdash;SINE IVRGIO,
SINE AEMVLATIONE, SINE DISSIDIO, SINE QVERELA&mdash;'Without
contention, without emulation, without
dissension, without strife.' There are no such
wives in Rome now, I'll be bound&mdash;at least in
the Rome I am acquainted with."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, with a sigh, "come
with me into yonder chapel. I always, in passing
this way, stop there to see again the sepulchre of
the best wife God ever gave to any man." After
walking in silence some minutes, he entered a
sort of family vault, and lit a bronze lamp, shaped
like a ship, hanging from the vaulted ceiling,
while Isidorus studied out the following inscription,
not altogether free from errors in spelling
and grammar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CONIVGE VENEVANDE BONE INNOCVA FLORENTIA<br />

"To my wife Florentia, deserving of honour, good,<br />

humble to all, a lover of the poor. She lived with me<br />
(<i>i.e.</i>, was married) thirty-two years, nine months, five<br />

&mdash;they were very scrupulous about this). She lived<br />
(altogether) fifty-two years, five months, more or less.<br />
The sore-broken husband bewails, with tears and bitter<br />
lamentation, his incomparable spouse."</p>

<p>"Yes, I made it all up, and carved it all
myself," said the old man, as Isidorus finished
reading the long inscription; "and if I say it
myself, I don't think there is a better in the
whole Catacomb; you see, I selected the best
bits from all the best epitaphs, and she deserved
it every word, dear soul," and he drew his rough
hand across his moistened eyes.</p>

<p>The easy-tempered Greek was too good-natured
to inflict wanton pain, so he ignored its bad
Latinity, and contented himself with saying that
"it was indeed a very remarkable epitaph."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they emerged from the gloom
of the Catacomb to the golden glory which was
flooding the broad Campagna from the westering
sun. "Would," thought Isidorus within himself,
"that I could thus emerge from the gloomy
doubts and fears in which my spirit gropes, to
the golden light of Christian life."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A DIFFICULT QUEST.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Empress Valeria had not forgotten her
purpose to discover, if possible, the father
of her freed-woman, Callirhoë, and at the earliest
opportunity took steps to accomplish her design.
It was, she knew, a task of much difficulty, and
one that required an intelligent and confidential
agent. It was also of the utmost importance
that some sign of identity should be exhibited
as a guarantee of the good faith of the agent.
With this view the Empress one day, as she sat
at her toilet in the apartment described in our
<a href="#CHAPTER_III">third chapter</a>, thus interrogated her freed-woman
and namesake, Valeria Callirhoë.</p>

<p>"Hast thou any token, child," she asked, "by
which, should we find thy father, he would be
assured of thy identity?"</p>

<p>"I was despoiled of everything, your Majesty,"
said the girl, "by the pirates by whom we were
captured; except the clothes in which I stood.
All my rings and jewellery were rudely snatched
away, and I never saw them again."</p>

<p>"What is that little amulet I have seen thee
wear?" asked the Empress; "I think thou hast
it now."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was so trivial and valueless," said
Callirhoë, "that they either overlooked it or
thought it not worth taking; "and she drew
from the folds of her robe, where it hung
suspended by a silken cord about her neck, a
cornelian stone, carved into the shape of a tiny
fish,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> on which was inscribed the word, ΣΩΤΗΡ,
or "Saviour," and on the other side the letters
ΚΑΛ.ΔΗΜΗΤ.ΘΥΓ&mdash;a contraction for "Callirhoë
daughter of Demetrius."</p>

<p>"Trivial as it is," said the girl, with emotion,
"it is something which I value above all price.
My sainted mother, before she died, took it from
her neck and put it upon mine; and I hope to
wear it while I live."</p>

<p>"You do not regard it as an amulet, or charm
against evil spirits, I am sure, like some Christians,
who have not quite shaken off their pagan superstitions."</p>

<p>"Nay, your Majesty, but as a symbol of our
holy faith. Yet it might well be a spell to keep
my soul from sin, so sacred are its associations."</p>

<p>"I want you to give it to me," said the
Empress.</p>

<p>"It is yours, your Majesty," said the girl,
taking it from her neck, and passionately kissing
it. "To no one else on earth would I give it; but
from my best benefactress I can withhold nothing."</p>

<p>"I would not put thee to the pain of parting
with it," said the Empress, with a kind caress,
"but I need it as a clue, to find, if possible, thy
father, and when found, as an identification of
his child. I do not wish to raise hopes which
may be doomed to disappointment; but I am
about to make a strenuous effort to discover thy
sire."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, dearest lady," exclaimed
the grateful girl, kissing her mistress's hands and
bedewing them with her tears. "I feel sure that
God will reward your efforts, and answer my
ceaseless prayers."</p>

<p>In pursuance of her purpose, the Empress
wrote upon a scroll of parchment the following
letter to her faithful counsellor, Adauctus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Valeria, consort of the co-Emperor Galerius
Cæsar&mdash;to Adauctus, Treasurer of the Imperial
Exchequer, greeting:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Honoured Servant,&mdash;Thy mistress hath need
of a faithful and intelligent agent, to execute a
delicate and difficult mission. He must be of
good address, and must be a man whom I can
implicitly trust. When thou hast found such,
bring him with thee to the palace." L.S.</p>

<p>Having bound the scroll with a silken cord,
and affixed her signet in purple wax, and
addressed the document to the Imperial Treasurer,
she sent it by a soldier of the guard, whom we
would describe in modern parlance as an
orderly-in-waiting, to Adauctus.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the day, the
chamberlain announced a visit from "His Excellency
the Imperial Treasurer." That officer was
received with much honour by the Empress, who
was attended only by her faithful freed woman.</p>

<p>"Many thanks, your Excellency, for your
prompt attendance. Have you found me the
paragon whom I require?"</p>

<p>"I cannot avouch for that, your Majesty, but
he is highly commended by his master, an honest
soldier, who places him at your Majesty's service.
Of his nimble wit and subtle parts, I can myself
bear witness, and my own servant testifies that
if not a Christian, he is at least a sincere inquirer
after the truth."</p>

<p>The Empress briefly explained the nature of
the commission which she wished executed, and
asked that the proposed agent, who waited in an
ante-room, might be presented. In a moment
the chamberlain announced our old friend
Isidorus. With bowed head and hands folded
upon his breast, he stood on the threshold, and
then advancing, knelt gracefully before the
Empress. He evidently made a good impression,
for her Majesty smiled graciously and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a difficult quest on which I would send
thee, but thou shalt be well rewarded for thy
fidelity and zeal."</p>

<p>"My humble services, my life, are at your
Majesty's disposal," said the Greek. "I shall
deem myself well rewarded by your Majesty's
favour."</p>

<p>"See'st thou this lady?" asked the Empress,
pointing to Callirhoë. "To find her sire in this
wide world&mdash;that is thy task;" and she briefly
explained the nature of the commission.</p>

<p>The youth gazed long and earnestly on the
fair face of the girl, and replied, "Those features
once seen can never be forgotten. If I find
anywhere on earth aught resembling them, I shall
not fail to recognize the likeness. In such a
quest I would gladly search the wide world over."</p>

<p>"My chamberlain will amply equip you for
your journey, and will give you a letter, with the
Emperor's seal, to all the Roman prefects in
Italy; and, by the Divine favour, I trust you
will bring us good tidings."</p>

<p>"So may it be," said the youth, as he retired
from the presence, giving, as he did so, a lingering
look at Callirhoë, who, with dilated eyes and
parted lips, gazed at him with an intensity of
entreaty that would have proved an inspiration
to a less susceptible nature than his.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A WICKED PLOT.</p>

<p class="dropcap">We have already mentioned the fact that
Fausta, the mother of the Emperor
Galerius, was a fanatical pagan. The especial
object of her regard was the goddess Cybele, who
was worshipped in Rome with rites of the most
degrading superstition. Fausta was intensely
bitter in her hatred of the Christian name, and
strenuously endeavoured to incite her son, the
Emperor, to persecution. She was especially
virulent towards her daughter-in-law, the
beautiful Valeria, and sought by every means to
embitter the mind of Galerius against her. In
this she was strongly abetted, or rather inspired,
by Furca, the vicious old priest of Cybele,
whose wicked influence over her was very great.
This worthy pair, the day after the interview
above described, were engaged in a secret conclave
or conspiracy against Valeria and the
Christians, while the latter was seeking to carry
out her benevolent enterprise.</p>

<p>The scene of their interview was the reception-room
of Fausta, in the palace of the Emperor
Galerius. It was far more sumptuously furnished
and decorated than that of the Empress Valeria,
and at one end, in a marble niche, stood an ugly
image of the goddess Cybele, with her crown of
many towers, rudely carved out of olive wood,
but quite embrowned, and almost blackened with
age. It was bedizened with costly jewels, and
was deemed to be of special sanctity. Before
it was a small marble altar, on which burned,
day and night, a silver censer.</p>

<p>At the moment of which we write, Fausta
approached the altar, and kissing her hand to
the image&mdash;an ancient mode of worship, from
which we get the word "adore"&mdash;she took some
costly Sabean incense from a small gold coffer,
and sprinkled it on the glowing coals of the
censer. Dense white fumes arose, whose rich
aromatic odour filled the large apartment. Fausta
had been an Illyrian peasant, and, notwithstanding
her embroidered robes and costly jewels,
she still exhibited much of the rude peasant
character and lack of culture. Her coarse and
wrinkled features and swarthy complexion, were
all the more striking by their contrast with the
snowy mantle, with its gold-embroidered border,
which she wore; and her bright black eyes
glittered with an expression of deadly malice
like those of a serpent. While she stood before
the altar, a servant announced that Furca, the
arch-priest of Cybele, had obeyed her summons.
As the curtain of the door was drawn aside, a
little weazened old man, as dark as mahogany,
wearing a thick crop of snow white hair, appeared.</p>

<p>"Thanks, good Furca," said Fausta, "I desire
your counsel on a matter of much importance to
the State, and to the worship of the holy
Cybele."</p>

<p>"At your service, your Excellency," said the
obsequious priest, who also kissed his hand to the
black-faced image, and sprinkled a few grains of
incense on the censer.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest how the worship of the
Galilean Christus has increased, not only among
the common people, the vile plebs, and the still
viler slave population, but even among the
patricians and nobles. I have evidence that even in
this palace, and very near the throne, the
execrable superstition is cherished."</p>

<p>"Alas! your Excellency, I fear it is only too
true," whined the bigot arch-priest. "Certain it
is that neither of the Empresses, Prisca or
Valeria, ever take part in the public worship of
the gods, as from their lofty station it is their
duty to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have reason to believe that there
is plotting and conniving between the Empress
and the accursed Christian sect."</p>

<p>"Hast any proof of this?" asked the arch-priest,
eagerly. "This is a crime against the
State."</p>

<p>"The black slave Juba," replied Fausta, "is, as
thou knowest, a faithful worshipper of Cybele,
and she told me even now, that Adauctus, the
Imperial Treasurer, had been only yesterday
closeted with the Empress, and plotting to restore
to the favour of the Emperor a certain Demetrius,
a Christian renegade, who is in hiding for his
crimes."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" chuckled the priest, with a wicked
grin, "my fine lady need not think herself so high
and mighty as to be above the reach of the law,
or beyond the anger of the insulted gods."</p>

<p>"I would almost give my eyes," hissed through
her teeth the revengeful Fausta, "if I could only
see that painted doll, Valeria, abased and degraded.
She has too long held a sway, of which I, the
mother of the Emperor, have been deprived."</p>

<p>"I trust you may not only see it," said Furca,
gloating in anticipation over the prospect, "but
also see her pale, proud mother, the Empress
Prisca, humbled at your feet."</p>

<p>"Accomplish this, good Furca," exclaimed
Fausta, with exultation, "and the goddess Cybele
shall have such an offering as she never had
before."</p>

<p>"We must be wary," said the priest, "or we
may ourselves be crushed. They are too powerful
to be attacked openly. We must plot
against them secretly. I'll be a <i>furca</i> to them
indeed," he added, punning upon his own name,
which had also the signification of an instrument
of punishment, something like a cross; and the
conspirators parted with this pledge of mutual
hate against their destined victims.</p>





<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE SLAVE MARKET.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the meantime Isidorus, with well-filled
purse, and armed with credentials under
the Imperial seal, had set off upon his difficult
and doubtful quest.</p>

<p>"However it turn out," he said to himself, "it
will be strange if I do not climb a few steps
higher on the ladder on which my feet are now
placed. Being the confidential agent of the
Empress is better than being the secretary of the
rude soldier, Sertorius, and being snubbed by him
every day, too."</p>

<p>Mounted on one of the best horses in the
Imperial stables, he rode forth upon the famous
Salarian Way, which led straight as an arrow
over the wide Campagna, and over the rugged
Appenines to the distant city of Ravenna, among
the marshes of the Adriatic. Now a decayed
and grass-grown city, six miles from the sea, it
was then a great and busy port, and had been for
two centuries and a half an important see of the
Christian Church. Not to the prefect of the
city, but to the bishop of Ravenna, Isidorus,
with his natural tact and shrewdness, betook
himself. The sign manual of the Emperor, which
he confidently exhibited, did not command that
regard which he had anticipated; but a private
letter from Adauctus, commending Isidorus to
all Christian bishops and presbyters, procured
for him a much more cordial reception. He
was hospitably entertained, and every possible
assistance given him in his quest. The bishop
called together the deacons who had the care of
the poor of the Church, but none of them knew
anything of Demetrius. The bishop had
ransomed many Christian slaves&mdash;prisoners taken in
war, or captured by pirates. A few years before,
when the resources of the Church had been
completely exhausted by the exercise of this
charity,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> a company of captives had been sold by
pirates to a Jewish slave-dealer named Ezra, and
conveyed by him to the city of Mediolanum, or
as we now call it, Milan, as offering, next to
Rome, the best market for his wares. And one
of the deacons remembered among this slave-gang
an old man who resembled the description given
of Demetrius.</p>

<p>To Milan, therefore, crossing again the
Appenines, and riding up the broad, rich valley of
the Po, went Isidorus. He was surprised to
find a city, almost rivalling in extent Rome
itself, and with a history reaching back to the
times of the Etruscans, well-nigh a thousand
years. First he sought the Jewish slave-dealer,
who kept a regular mart for the sale or hire of
human beings, just as one now-a-days keeps a
livery-stable for the sale or hire of horses. There
was as much fraud, too, in selling slaves then,
as has been proverbially connected with
horse-dealing and jockeying in every age. The <i>ergastulum</i>,
or slave-pen of Ezra, was a large prison-like
structure, surrounding the four sides of a hollow
square. There were no windows to the street,
and only very small iron-grated ones to the inner
court; with heavy, iron-studded doors to the
stable-like stalls, where the slaves were chained
to a stout beam running along the wall.</p>

<p>A slave-auction was in progress when Isidorus
arrived, so he had to wait till it was over before
plying his quest. A gang of slaves, unchained,
but guarded by keepers, armed with whips and
spears, awaited their fate. Stripped nearly naked,
they were rudely examined, pinched, handled,
and made to stoop, lift heavy weights, walk, run,
and show their paces like horses for sale. Many
had their ears bored&mdash;a sign of servitude from
the time of Moses&mdash;and others were seamed with
scars of the cruel lash. This, however, lessened
their market value, as it was evidence of their
intractable and troublesome character.</p>

<p>Slavery was, at the time of which we write,
one of the greatest evils of the Roman empire.
It was a deadly canker, eating out the national
life. It cast a stigma of disgrace on labour, and
prevented the formation of that intelligent middle
class which is the true safeguard of liberty.
Never in the history of the world was society so
based upon the abject misery of vast multitudes
of human beings. The slaves outnumbered,
many times, their masters. They were forbidden
to wear a peculiar garb, lest they should
recognize their numbers and their strength, and rise
in universal revolt. As it was, servile
insurrections were of frequent occurrence. But they
were crushed and punished with ruthless severity.
In one slave revolt, 60,000 of these wretched
beings were slain. The first question about a
man's property was, <i>"Quot pascit servos?"</i>&mdash;"How
many slaves does he keep?" Ten was considered
the least number consistent with any degree of
respectability. Four hundred slaves deluged with
their blood the funeral pyre of Pedanius Secundus.
Vidius Pollio fed his lampreys with the
bodies of his human chattels. A single freed-man
left over 4,000 at his death. Some 2,000
men were lords of the Roman world, and the
great mass of the rest were slaves. Their
condition was one of inconceivable wretchedness.
They had no rights of marriage, nor any claim to
their children. Their food was a pound of bread
a day, with a little salt and oil. Flesh they
never tasted, and even wine, which flowed like
water, almost never. Colossal piles, built by
their blood and sweat, attest to the present day
the bitterness of their bondage. The lash of the
taskmaster was heard in the fields, and crosses,
bearing aloft their quivering victims, polluted the
wayside.</p>

<p>This dumb, weltering mass of humanity,
crushed by power, and led by their lusts, became
a hot-bed of vice, in which every evil passion
grew apace. To these wretched beings came the
gospel of liberty, with a strange, a thrilling power.
The oppressed slave, in the intervals of toil or
torture, caught with joy the emancipating
message, and sprang up enfranchised by an
immortalizing hope. He exulted in a new-found
freedom in Christ, which no wealth could purchase,
no chains of slavery fetter, nor even death
itself destroy. In the Christian Church the
distinctions of worldly rank were abolished.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The highest spiritual privileges were opened to
the lowliest slave. In the ecclesiastical hierarchy
were no rights of birth, and no privileges of
blood. In the inscriptions of the Catacombs, no
badges of servitude, no titles of honour appear.
The wealthy noble, the lord of many acres,
recognized in his lowly servant a fellow heir
of glory. They bowed together at the same
table of the Lord, saluted each other with the
mutual kiss of charity, and side by side in their
narrow graves, at length returned to indistinguishable
dust. The story of Onesimus was often
repeated, and the patrician master received his
returning slave, "not now as a servant, but
above a servant&mdash;a brother beloved." Nay, he
may even have bowed to him as his ecclesiastical
superior, and received from his plebeian hands
the emblems of their common Lord.</p>

<p>We return from this digression to the slave-market
of Milan. Very few of Ezra's stock were
black&mdash;not more than half a dozen, from Nubia
and Libya. Most of them were as white as
himself, or whiter still. There were Dalmatians,
Illyrians, Iberians, Gauls, Greeks, Syrians, and
many other nationalities. Ezra was engaged
in busy converse, in a broken mixture of Latin
and Greek, with the wealthy patrician, Vitellius,
the lord of wide corn lands on the fertile banks
of the Po.</p>

<p>"Field hands your Excellency wants? I have
some splendid ones," he said, eagerly. "Here,
you fellows, step out there and show your
muscles;" and he struck with his whip-lash two
brawny white-skinned, blue-eyed, yellow-haired
British slaves.</p>

<p>"Sullen dogs these British often are," he said,
"but they are as good as gold. They never run
away like the Germans, nor steal like the Greeks,
nor kill themselves like the Gauls."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>"Glad of that," said Vitellius. "I have had a
perfect epidemic of suicide among my slaves. I
had to kill several of them to keep them from
killing themselves"&mdash;a sad but frequent comment
on the utter wretchedness of their condition,
from which death itself was the only
refuge.</p>

<p>"Does your Excellency want anything of a
higher grade?" asked Ezra. "Some skilled
workmen to finish your elegant villa, for instance.
I have a splendid Greek sculptor, almost another
Phidias, and another a second Zeuxis with the
brush. Then if you want a steward, or bookkeeper,
or secretary, or reader, or a skilled physician,
I have them all; or a hand-maid for your
Excellency's wife. I have a beautiful Greek girl
here, highly accomplished; can embroider, play
the zither, sing in two languages. I sold her
sister last week for 100,000 sesterces<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;nieces
of an ex-archon. I felt really sorry for them, but
what would you?&mdash;trade is trade. Times are
bad. Poor Ezra has had bad luck. Several of
his slaves kill themselves. Market glutted; price
falls. I sell them very cheap&mdash;very cheap."</p>

<p>Vitellius made his purchases, had them chained
together in a gang, and driven by his steward,
like cattle, to his farm. The account of Ezra's
interview with Isidorus we must defer to another

<p class="center">THE LOST FOUND.</p>

<p class="dropcap">"Do you remember buying or selling a slave
named Demetrius, a Jew?" asked Isidorus
of Ezra, the slave-dealer of Milan. He
wasted no words in circumlocution, for he knew
that there was no use in trying to deceive
the keen-eyed Jewish dealer in his fellowman;
and that his best chances of success were
in coming directly to the point.</p>

<p>"Selling a Jew? Oh, no! I never sell my
own kinsmen. That's against our law. It is
like seething a kid in its mother's milk. I
often ransom them from pirates and set them
free."</p>

<p>"But this Demetrius was a Christian Jew&mdash;a
convert from Moses to Jesus," said the Greek.</p>

<p>"A Christian dog," cried Ezra with a wicked
execration. "He was no Jew. He had sold
his birthright like Esau, and had no part nor
lot with Israel. Of course, I'd sell him if I
got him&mdash;to the mines, or to the galleys, or
the field gang, to the hardest master I could
find. But I know naught about your Demetrius,
who was he?"</p>

<p>"He was a Jew of Antioch," said Isidorus,
"captured by Illyrian pirates and sold in the
slave market of Ravenna."</p>

<p>"That is a common tale," replied Ezra.
"There are many such. How long since this
occurred?"</p>

<p>"'Tis now five years since he was last seen
by her who seeks him, and who will pay well
for his recovery."</p>

<p>"Just my luck," grumbled the greedy Jew.
"Some one else will gain the prize. 'Tis not
for me."</p>

<p>"Then you cannot help me in this quest?"
said the Greek.</p>

<p>"How can I remember the scores and hundreds
of Christian dogs that I have bought
and sold? Go ask these monks, they know
more of the vermin than I do."</p>

<p>Acting on this hint, Isidorus made his way
to the Convent of San Lorenzo, the ancient
chapel of which still remains. Knocking at
a bronze-studded gateway he was admitted to
a quadrangle surrounded by cloisters or covered
galleries upon which opened the doors of the
different apartments. It was more like a
hospital and alms-house than like what is now
understood as a convent. It served as a sort
of school of theology, youthful acolytes and
deacons being here trained for the office and
work of presbyters in the Church. Isidorus
presented his letter from Adauctus to the good
Bishop Paulinus, and was most cordially received.</p>

<p>"Right welcome art thou, my son," said the
bishop, "bearing, as thou dost, the commendation
of the worthy Adauctus; and right glad
shall we be to promote thy search. I myself
know naught that can throw light upon it,
inasmuch as I lived not at Milan, but was
bishop of Nola at the time of which thou
speakest."</p>

<p>The scriptor, or secretary, of the convent was
also consulted without avail, no record being
found in the annals of the house that gave
any hope of discovery.</p>

<p>"Come lunch with us in the refectory," said
the bishop, "and I will ask if any of the
brethren know aught of this mystery."</p>

<p>The refectory was a large bare-looking room&mdash;its
only furniture being a long and solid table
with a shorter one across the end for the bishop,
and presbyters, and visitors. Of this latter
there were frequently several, as such houses
were the chief places for entertaining the travelling
clergy or even lay members of the Christian
brotherhood. Upon the walls were certain
somewhat grim-looking frescoes, representing
Biblical scenes and characters like those in
the Catacombs described in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">chapter VIII.</a> At
one side of the room was a <i>bema</i>, or reading-desk,
at which one of the lectors a distinct
ecclesiastical office,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> with its special ordination&mdash;read,
while the brethren partook of their
meals, the lessons for the day from the Gospels
and Epistles, as well as passages from the
writings of Clement, Ignatius, Justin Martyr,
and Origen. For this usage the scarcity and
high price of MS. books, and the desire to
improve every moment of time was deemed
a sufficient ground.</p>

<p>After the meal&mdash;which was almost ascetic in
its simplicity, consisting chiefly of vegetable
pottage, lentils, and bread was over, and the
reading ended, the bishop explained the cause
of the presence among them of a stranger from
Rome.</p>

<p>"My brethren," he said in conclusion, "this
is a common story. Many are the victims of
cruelty and wrong in this great empire. Be
it ours, so far as God may give us power, to
succour the oppressed and redress their wrongs."</p>

<p>As he sat down a venerable presbyter rose
and said, "Father, five years have I been under
this hospitable roof, ransomed from bondage
by your predecessor in office. Five years have
I mourned the loss of a son and daughter, sold
from my arms to I know not what cruel fate.
It may be that God is about to restore me
my children, the flesh of my flesh. Hast thou,
stranger, any sign or token by which I may
be assured of their identity?"</p>

<p>"Of thy son I have no tidings; but know
thou if this be a token of thy daughter's
rescue," and Isidorus exhibited the small
cornelian <i>tessara</i> of the fish of which we have spoken.</p>

<p>Eagerly the old man clasped it, and scanned
the inscription, and joyfully exclaimed, while
tears of gladness flowed down his aged cheeks
and silvery beard, "Thank God, my child yet
lives. I shall again behold her before I die.
See, here is her very name, 'Callirhoë, daughter
of Demetrius.' I carved it with my own hands
one happy day in our dear home in Damascus.
God is good. I never hoped to see her again.
Tell me, stranger, is she, too, a slave?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Isidorus with emotion, for even
his careless nature was touched with sympathy
at the joy of the old man, "She is the freed
woman of the Empress Valeria, and high in
favour, too, I should judge, from the interest
her august mistress showed in seeking for thee."</p>

<p>"<i>Benedic, anima mea, Domino,</i>" exclaimed the
aged presbyter with fervour. "<i>Et omnia, quæ
intra me sunt, nomini sacro ejus</i>&mdash;Bless the Lord,
my soul: and all that is within me bless His
holy name. He hath heard my prayer. He
hath answered my supplication."</p>

<p>The old man's story was soon told. He had
been rescued from the slave pen of Ezra, and
employed in the service of the convent. His
familiar knowledge of Greek led to his
appointment as instructor in that language of the
young acolytes and deacons who were in training
for the office of the ministry. At length
his superior gifts and fervent piety led to his
own ordination as a presbyter of the Church
of Milan.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">FATHER AND DAUGHTER.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Demetrius was now eager to set out for
Rome to behold once more the child
whom he had scarce hoped ever to see again.
A happy leave-taking of the brethren of Milan,
who rejoiced in fraternal sympathy, followed;
and on a gently ambling mule, at break of day,
the old man rode forth beside the gallantly
equipped Isidorus. He beguiled the weary way
with questions about his long-lost daughter,
as to her growth, appearance, her apparent
health, and even the very garb she wore. He
was never tired hearing about her, and
recounting incidents of her childhood and youth.
The only shadow upon his joy was the vague
mystery concerning the fate of his son. But he
said cheerfully: "God is good. He has restored
to me one of my children. I feel confident that
in His own good time He will restore also
the other."</p>

<p>Beneath the fatigue of the long journey of
nearly three hundred miles his powers would
have failed, had he not been inspirited and
sustained by the thrilling anticipation of
beholding once more his beloved child.</p>

<p>At length, near sunset, on the tenth day, they
drew near the great metropolis of the Empire.
Clearer and clearer to the view rose the seven-hilled
city's pride, the snowy marble peristyles
and pediments of palace and temple, gleaming
in the rosy light like transparent alabaster. To
the left rose the cliff-like walls of the Colosseum,
even then venerable with the time-stains of
over two hundred years. In the foreground
stretched the long Aurelian Wall, with its towers
and battlements and strong arched gates. They
crossed the Tiber by the Milvian Bridge, built
three hundred years before, and destined to
witness within ten years that fierce struggle
for the mastery of the empire, between
Constantine and Maxentius, when the British-born
Cæsar saw, or thought he saw, in the mid-day
heavens a blazing cross, and exclaiming "By
this sign we conquer," overwhelmed his adversary
in the rushing river.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Passing under the hill crowned with the
famous gardens of Lucullus, now known as the
Pincio, and beneath the heavy-arched gateway
in the wall, they made their way through the
narrow streets towards the centre of the city
the&mdash;Forum and the Palatine. It was a day
of festival&mdash;the last day of the <i>Quinquatria</i>,
or festival of Minerva. Garlands of flowers,
and wreaths of laurel, festooned many of the
houses, in front of which blazed coloured cressets
and lamps. Sacred processions were passing
through the streets, with torches and music
and chantings of priests; and ever and anon
the shrill blare of the sacred trumpets pierced
the ear of night. In the Forum the temples
of Saturn, and of Castor, and Pollux were
richly adorned and brilliantly illuminated, and
a great throng of merry-makers filled the
marble square.</p>

<p>Turning to the left, our travellers ascended
the slope of the Palatine Hill, amid
ever-increasing grandeur of architecture. Demetrius,
though he had travelled far and seen much,
was struck with astonishment at the splendour
and magnificence of the buildings. Not at
Jerusalem, or Damascus, or Antioch, not at
Ravenna or Milan, had he witnessed such wealth
of porphyry and marble, such stately colonades
and peristyles, covering acres of ground&mdash;now
but a mound of mouldering ruins.</p>

<p>"Whither art thou leading me?" asked
Demetrius, as they stood before a palace of
snowy marble which, bathed in the mellow
radiance of the rising moon, seemed transformed
into translucent alabaster.</p>

<p>"To the abode where dwells thy daughter,
the favoured freed-woman of the mistress of all
this splendour," replied Isidorus, enjoying the
wonder and admiration of his companion in
travel.</p>

<p>A fountain splashed in the centre of the
square, its waters flashing like silver in the
moonlight. The burnished mail of the Roman
soldiers gleamed as the guard was changed, and
their armour clashed as they grounded their
spears and saluted the officer of the watch.</p>

<p>"What, Max, are you on duty to-night?" said
Isidorus as he recognized a soldier of the guard.
"Any promotion in your service yet?"</p>

<p>"No, but I see that there is in yours," said
the bluff out-spoken guardsman.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I flatter myself that there is,"
replied the vain-glorious Greek, "and I hope for
still more."</p>

<p>Announcing to the chamberlain of the palace
that he had just arrived from a journey of
important business for the Empress Valeria, he
with Demetrius were taken to a marble bath,
where with the aid of a skilful slave, they made
their toilet for immediate presentation to the
Empress.</p>

<p>Valeria was attended as usual by her freed-woman
Callirhoë, when the Greek was announced.</p>

<p>"We heard," she said to Isidorus, "by thy
letters, of the failure of thy quest at Ravenna
and Milan, but we hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment, with an exclamation of
intensest emotion Callirhoë rushed forward and
flung herself in the arms of the venerable figure
who had followed the Greek into the apartment.</p>

<p>"My father!" she cried in tones which thrilled
every heart, and then she embraced him again
and again. The impassioned love and joy and
gratitude of her soul struggling for expression,
she burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"My daughter, child of my beloved Rachel,"
exclaimed the old man, as, heedless of the
presence of the Empress, he fondly caressed her,
"do I again embrace thee? Thou art the very
image of thy angel-mother, as I first beheld
her in the rose gardens of Sharon. Truly God
is good. Now, Lord, lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace&mdash;the cup of my happiness
runneth over."</p>

<p>"Nay, good father," broke in the soft voice
of the Empress, who was deeply moved by the
scene, "rather live to share thy daughter's love
and happiness."</p>

<p>"Pardon, august lady," said Demetrius, falling
on his knees, and gratefully kissing the
Empress's hand. "Pardon, that in the joy of finding
my child I forgot the duty I owe to my
sovereign."</p>

<p>"Thy first duty was there," said Valeria, pointing
to the lovely Callirhoë, who, smiling through
her tears, was now leaning on her father's arm.
"We leave you to exchange your mutual confidences.
Good Isidorus it shall be our care
to bestow a reward commensurate with thy
merit;" and she withdrew to her own apartment.</p>

<p>"My everlasting gratitude thou hast," said
Callirhoë, with her sweetest smile, frankly extending
her hand.</p>

<p>"I am, indeed, well repaid," said the Greek,
as he respectfully kissed it. "I would gladly
show my zeal in much more arduous service,"
and bowing low, he was accompanied by the
chamberlain to the vestibule. That official gave
him, by command of the Empress, a purse of
gold, and assured him of still further reward.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"UNSTABLE AS WATER."</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was with feelings highly elated at his
successful achievement, which presaged
still further advancement, that Isidorus sought
his lodgings. On the way he met many late
revellers returning from the festival, "flown
with insolence and wine," and making night
hideous with their riot. Among them, his
garments dishevelled, and a withering garland
falling from his brow, was an old acquaintance,
Calphurnius, the son of the Perfect, who with
maudlin affection embraced him and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friend of my soul, where hast thou hidden
thyself? Our wine parties lack half their zest,
since thou hast turned anchorite. Come, pledge
our ancient friendship in a goblet of Falernian.
The wine shop of Turbo, the ex-gladiator, is
near at hand."</p>

<p>"You have not turned Christian, have you?"
hiccoughed the drunken reveller; "no offence,
but I heard you had, you know."</p>

<p>Isidorus gave a start. Were his visits to the
Catacomb known to this fashionable fop?
Were they a matter of sport to him and his
boon companions? Was he to be laughed out
of his nascent convictions by these empty-headed
idlers? No, he determined. He despised
the whole crew. But he was not the stuff out
of which martyrs are made, and he lacked the
courage to confess to this gilded butterfly, his
as yet faltering feeling towards Christianity.</p>

<p>"Who says I am?" he asked, anxious to
test his knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>"Who says so? I don't know. Why everybody,"
was the rather vague reply.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are talking about,
man," said the Greek, with a forced laugh.
"Go home and sleep off your carouse."</p>

<p>"All right. I told them so. The Christians,
indeed, the vermin! Come to the Baths of
Caracalla at noon to-morrow and I'll tell you
all about it."</p>

<p>Isidorus went to his lodgings and retired
to his couch, but not to slumber. He was like
a boat drifting rudderless upon the sea, the
sport of every wind that blew. He had no
strength of will, no fixedness of purpose, no
depth of conviction. His susceptible disposition
was easily moved to generous impulses and even
to noble aspirations, yet he had no moral
firmness. He is portrayed to the life by the
words of the great Teacher, "He that received
the seed into stony places, the same is he that
heareth the Word, and anon, with joy receiveth
it; yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth
for a while; for when tribulation or persecution
ariseth because of the Word, bye-and-bye he
is offended."</p>

<p>"Did his boon companions," he questioned,
"suspect that any serious convictions had penetrated
beneath his light and careless exterior?"
All his good resolutions had begun like wax
in a furnace to melt and give way at the
sneer and jeer of the shallow fool from whom
he had just parted&mdash;a creature whom in his
inmost heart he despised. Strange contradiction
of human nature! Like the epicurean poet,
he saw and approved the better way and yet
he followed the worse.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> He seemed to gain
in the few casual words he had heard, a glimpse
of the possibilities of persecution which menaced
him if faithful to his convictions, and he had
act moral fibre enough to encounter them. And
yet his conscience stung and tortured him as
he tossed upon his restless couch. Toward
morning he fell asleep and it was broad day
when he awoke. His reflections were as
different from those with which he fell asleep
as the brilliant daylight was from the gloomy
shadows of night. The air was full of the busy
hum of life. Water sellers and fruit pedlers
and the like were crying "<i>Aqua Gelata</i>" "Fresh
Figs," and "White wine and red." Cohorts of
soldiers were clattering in squadrons, through
the streets, the sunlight glittering on their
spearpoints and on the bosses of their shields
and armour. Jet black Nubian slaves, clad in
snowy white, were bearing in gold-adorned
<i>lecticæ</i> or palanquins, proud patrician dames,
robed in saffron and purple, to visit the shops
of the jewellers and silk mercers. Senators
and civic officials were flocking to the Forum
with their murmuring crowd of clients. Gilded
youths were hastening to the schools of the
rhetoricians or of the gladiators, both alike
deemed necessary instructors of these pinks
of fashion. The streets and squares were a
perfect kaleidoscope of colour and movement&mdash;an
eddying throng, on business or on pleasure
bent.</p>

<p>The stir and animation of the scene dispelled
all serious thoughts from the mind of the
frivolous Greek. He plunged like a strong
swimmer into the stream of eager busy life
surging through the streets. He was one of
the gayest of the gay, ready with his laugh
and joke as he met his youthful comrades.</p>

<p>"Ho, Rufus, whither away in such mad
haste," he cried as he saw a young officer of
the 12th Legion dashing past in his chariot,
driving with admirable skill two milk-white
steeds through the crowded streets.</p>

<p>"Oh! are you there? Where have you
hidden yourself for the last month?" exclaimed
Rufus, as he sharply reined up his steeds. "To
the Baths of Caracalla; will you go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very gladly," said Isidorus, stepping
upon the low platform of the open bronze
chariot. "I have been beyond the Po, on a
special service&mdash;a barbarous region. No baths,
circus, or games like those of Rome."</p>

<p>"There is but one Rome," said the fiery young
Hotspur, "but I am beginning to hate it. I
am fairly rusting with idleness and long for
active service&mdash;whether amid Libyian sands or
Pannonian forests, I care not."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," replied the effeminate Greek,
"that I could console myself with your horses
and chariot&mdash;the coursers of Achilles were not
more swift&mdash;and with the delights which Rome
and its fair dames are eager to lavish on that
favourite of fortune, Ligurius Rufus."</p>

<p>"<i>Vanitas vanitatis</i>," yawned the youth. "Life
is a tremendous bore. I was made for action,
for conquest, for state craft; but under this
despotism of the Cæsars, we are all slaves
together. You and I fare a little better than
that Nubian porter yonder, that is all."</p>

<p>"Yet you seem to bear your bondage very
comfortably," laughed the light-hearted Greek,
"and had I your fortune, so would I."</p>

<p>"Mehercule! the fetters gall though they be
golden," ejaculated the soldier, lashing his steeds
into swifter flight, as if to give vent to his
nervous excitement. "I plunge into folly to
forget that I am a slave. Lost a hundred
thousand sesterces at dice last night. The
empire is hurrying to chaos. There are no
paths of honour and ambition open to a man.
One must crouch like a hound or crawl like
a serpent to win advancement in the state.
I tell you the degenerate Romans of to-day
are an effete and worn out race. The rude
Dacians beyond the Tiber possess more of the
hardy virtues of the founders of the Republic
than the craven creatures who crawl about
the feet of the modern Colossi, who bestride
the world and are worshipped almost as gods.
And unless Rome mends her ways they will
be the masters of the Empire yet."</p>

<p>"One would think you were Cato the Censor,"
laughed the Greek. "For my part, I think the
best philosophy is that of my wise countryman,
Epicurus&mdash;'to take the times as they come,
and make the most of them.' But here we
are at the Thermæ."</p>

<p>Giving his horses to one of the innumerable
grooms belonging to the establishment, Rufus
and his friend disappeared under the lofty arched
entrance of the stately Baths of Caracalla.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="center">AT THE BATHS.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Nothing can give one a more striking
conception of Roman life under the Empire
than the size, number, and magnificence of the
public baths. Those of Caracalla are a typical
example. They covered an area of fifteen
hundred by twelve hundred and fifty feet, the
surrounding grounds being a mile in circumference.
They formed a perfect wilderness of
stately halls, and corridors, and chambers, the
very mouldering remains of which strike one
with astonishment. Of this very structure, the
poet Shelley, in the preface of his "Prometheus
Unbound," remarks: "This poem was chiefly
written upon the mountainous ruins of the Baths
of Caracalla, among the flowery glades and
thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees, which
are extended in ever-widening labyrinths upon
its immense platforms, and dizzy arches
suspended in the air." Piers of sold masonry soar
aloft like towers, on the summit of which
good-sized trees are growing. Climbing one of those
massive towers, the present writer enjoyed a
glorious sunset-view of the mighty maze, of the
crumbling ruins which rose like stranded wrecks
above the sea of verdure all around, and of the
far spreading and desolate Campagna.</p>

<p>The great hypocausts, or subterranean furnaces,
can be still examined, as also the caleducts
in the walls for hot air, and the metal pipes for
hot and cold water. The baths were supplied by
an aqueduct constructed for that purpose, the
arches of which may be seen bestriding the
Campagna for a distance of fourteen miles from
the city. There were hot, and cold, and tepid
baths, <i>caldaria</i>, or sweating chambers, <i>frigidaria</i>,
or cooling rooms, <i>unctoria</i>, or anointing rooms,
and many others sufficient to accommodate
sixteen hundred bathers at once. There were
also a vast gymnasium for exercise, a <i>stadium</i>,
or race-course, and a <i>pinacotheca</i>, or art gallery.
Here were found the famous Farnese Bull, the
largest group of ancient statuary extant, and many
<i>chefs d'&#339;uvre</i> of classic sculpture and mosaics.</p>

<p>The Baths of Diocletian, built by the labours
of the Christians during the last great persecution,
one authority says, were twice as large,
and could accommodate eighteen thousand bathers
in a day, but that seems incredible. One of
its great halls, a hundred yards by thirty in area,
and thirty yards high, was converted by Michael
Angelo into a church. Of the remainder, part
is used as a monastery, part as barracks, and part
as an orphanage, a poor-house, and an asylum
for the blind, and much is in ruins. At Pompeii
is a public bath in perfect preservation, with the
niches for the clothing, soaps, and unguents of
the bathers, and even the <i>strigils</i>, or bronze
instruments for scraping the skin&mdash;the same
after eighteen hundred years as though used but
yesterday. By these means we are able to
reconstruct the outward circumstances of that old
Roman life, almost as though we had shared
its busy movement.</p>

<p>As Ligurius Rufus drew aside the heavy
matting of the doorway of the Thermæ, of
Caracalla, which then, as now, kept out the
summer heat from the buildings of Rome, a busy
scene burst upon his view. A great hall, lighted
by openings in the roof, was filled with gay
groups of patrician Romans, sauntering, chatting,
laughing, exchanging news, betting on the next
races, and settling bets on the last. As the
modern clubman goes to his club to see the
papers and learn the current gossip, so all the
idlers in Rome came to the baths as to a social
exchange, to learn the latest bit of court scandal
or public news.</p>

<p>"Ho, Calphurnius!" said Rufus, to the now
sobered son of the city Prefect; "what's in the
wind to-day? You know all the mischief that's
going."</p>

<p>"Sorry I cannot maintain my reputation then.
Things are dull as an old <i>strigil</i>. Oh, by the
way," and he beckoned them into a recess behind
a porphyry pillar, "there is going to be a precious
row up at the palace. I tell you in confidence.
The old vixen, Fausta, has got a new spite
against the Empress Valeria, whom all the people
of the palace love. The termagant is not fit to
carry water for her bath. She has found some
mare's nest of a Christian plot,&mdash;by the way you
are mixed up in it, friend Isidorus. I would
advise you to have a care. In the fight of
Pagan against Christian, I fear Valeria will get
the worst of it, <i>dii avertant</i>."</p>

<p>"The palace walls are not glass," laughed
Isidorus, "nor have you a Dionysius' ear. How
know you all this?"</p>

<p>"As if the Roman Prefect did not know what
goes on, that he thinks worth knowing, in every
house in Rome! He has eyes and ears in his
pay everywhere; and when honest Juba, or
Tubal, come with their secret intelligence, they
are not above accepting double pay and letting
me into the secret, too. Besides that crafty
old vulture Furca was closeted with the Prefect
for an hour by the clepshydra, and you always
smell carrion when he is hovering round."</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" asked Rufus. "I am
sure Valeria is as much beloved by the people
as the old termagant Fausta is hated."</p>

<p>"There's the rub&mdash;a bit of spiteful jealousy,"
answered Calphurnius. "But when that old
basilisk hates, she will find a way to sting."</p>

<p>"But what have I to do with the quarrels
of the palace?" asked Isidorus, a little anxiously,
for he knew not how far he might be
compromised by the commission he had executed,
of which he had felt not a little proud.</p>

<p>"You know best yourself," answered
Calphurnius with a laugh. "If you have done a
service to Valeria or the Christians, you have
made an enemy of Fausta and the Pagans."</p>

<p>"Is this what you spoke of last night, and
promised to explain to-day?" asked the Greek.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. I have no very distinct
recollection of what I said. I had been supping
with Rufus here, and some other roystering
blades, and the Folernian was uncommonly good.
Come, <i>amicus meus</i>," he went on turning to
Ligurius, "don't you want revenge for those
sesterces you lost last night?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do punish you a little,"
yawned the young soldier. "It will kill the
time for awhile, at all events."</p>

<p class="center">THE GAMING TABLE.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Gaming was a perfect passion among the
Romans, and indeed among most ancient
nations. Dice of bone and ivory, like those
in use to-day, have been found in the tombs of
Thebes and Luxor. Æschylus and Sophocles
describe their use four hundred years before
Christ, and in an ancient Greek picture now
before us, a female figure is shown tossing <i>tali</i>,
or gaming cubes, and catching them on the
back of her hand, as children now play "Jacks."
Soldiers from the enforced idleness of much of
their time and the intense excitement of the
rest of it, have in every age been addicted to
gambling to beguile the <i>ennui</i> of their too ample
leisure&mdash;from those of Alexander down to the
raw recruits of to-day. Our friend, Ligurius
Rufus, had undergone frequent experience of
the pains and pleasures of this siren vice; but
was eager to return to its embrace. Such vast
estates had been squandered, and great families
impoverished, and large fortunes often staked
upon a single throw of the dice&mdash;beyond anything
that Homburg or Monaco ever saw&mdash;that
gambling was forbidden by successive Roman
laws. But when were not the rich able to
indulge in their favourite vices, even under a
much purer Government than that of Rome?
So even in this place of public resort, were
numerous alcoves in which stood gaming tables,
while money changers&mdash;generally Jews&mdash;had
tables near for giving good Roman sesterces
in exchange for the <i>oboloi</i> or <i>drachmai</i> of Greece,
the shekels of Jerusalem, or the scarabæus coins
of Egypt. Into one of these alcoves the three
friends now turned, Isidorus promising himself
that he would only look on. He had been
excessively addicted to play, but had,
notwithstanding occasional success, lost so much money
that he had abjured the seductive vice, especially
since his visit to the Catacomb with his friend
Faustus, who had urged him to forsake a practice
so perilous in itself, and so opposed to Christian
conduct.</p>

<p>Calphurnius and Rufus sat down to the gaming
table, and the Greek stood looking on. The
gold was placed in two piles on the board. The
dice rattled, and eager eyes took in at a glance
the number of red spots on the upper surface.
Rufus seemed to have recovered his good fortune.
Throw after throw was successful.</p>

<p>"That is the <i>Jadus Venereus</i>," he exclaimed
with exultation, as he made the cast that counted
highest. "We must have wine and I must be
toast-master," for so was called the leader of the
revels.</p>

<p>The Greek watched with honest interest the
play, his eye flashing and his pulse quickening
under its strange spell. The richest wines of
Chios and Lesbos were ordered; and as the
wine was poured into jewelled goblets, he required
slight urging to partake of the fragrant vintage
of the Isles of Greece. The eager play was
resumed. The Greek noted each practised turn
of the wrist and cast of the dice&mdash;his eye
kindling and his brain throbbing with the subtle
intoxication of both the game and the wine.</p>

<p>"I've won enough," said Rufus, "I've got back
my own, and more. I don't want to ruin you,
my good fellow," and he positively declined to
play any more. His honest nature recoiled from
taking that for which he gave no value, beyond
recouping his previous losses.</p>

<p>"Will you try a cast," he added, turning to
Isidorus. "Our friend has lots of money to
lose?" and he lounged away to watch the game
of ball in the Gymnasium.</p>

<p>"Yes, take a turn, my luck is wretched to-day!"
exclaimed Calphurnius. "Come, I will stake
that pile of gold on a single cast."</p>

<p>The Greek's whole frame was tingling with
excitement&mdash;yet he was withheld by some lingering
restraint of his promise to Faustus to abandon
play. Calphurnius again rattled the dice, the
cast was a complete blank&mdash;the worst possible
combination.</p>

<p>"'Twas lucky for me you were not playing
then," he said, laughing; "but I'll risk another
if you will."</p>

<p>"It must only be for a small stake&mdash;a single
sesterce," said the infatuated youth, quaffing a
goblet of wine. "I have given up gambling."</p>

<p>"All right," said his friend, "it's only for
amusement that I play," and he cast again, and
laughing paid over his forfeit.</p>

<p>Isidorus continued to win, each time taking
a sip of the strong heady wine. The baleful
enchantment was upon him.</p>

<p>"Double the stakes!" he cried.</p>

<p>"I thought you would tire of our playing like
slaves with jackstones," replied the cool-headed
Calphurnius. "This is something like play," he
continued, as they doubled every time, till the
stakes were soon enormous. The tide of fortune
now turned; but the Greek had become perfectly
reckless. Conscience was dead, a demon
greed for gain had taken possession of his soul,
the gaming-madness surged through his brain.
He doubled and redoubled his stakes, till before
he rose he had lost even the gold received from
Valeria the night before, and was beggared to
his last denarius. With blood-shot eyes and
staggering gait he reeled away from the table,
his handsome features convulsed with rage and
wicked imprecations pouring from his lips.</p>

<p>"Don't be so vexed about it, man," said his
tormentor, for so he regarded Calphurnius.
"Better luck to-morrow. Here I'll lend you
enough to set you up. Let us have a bath, we
both of us need it to quiet our nerves."</p>

<p>Isidorus, in his maudlin intoxication, accepted
the offer, and declared, with much idle babble,
that there was more money where that which
he had lost came from&mdash;that his services were
too valuable to the state to be overlooked&mdash;and
that he knew a thing or two&mdash;that he could tell
some secrets, if he would&mdash;and much more to
the same purpose.</p>

<p>This was just what Calphurnius wanted. He
had been set on by his father, the Prefect Naso
to worm from the Greek the secrets of the Palace
and the Catacomb, and this by a series of
wheedling questions he completely succeeded in
doing. With some difficulty he got his victim
home after he had extorted from him all that
he cared to know. When Isidorus awoke next
morning it was with feelings of intense disgust
with himself and with all the world. He felt
that he had played the fool, but how far he
knew not. He remembered that he had lost all
his money, yet he found a few coins in his purse.
He felt that he had forfeited the confidence
of his new patron Adauctus, of the Empress,
and even was undeserving of the gratitude or
respect of the beautiful freed-woman, Callirhoë,
whose father he had restored. He had learned
that there was a plot on foot against them all.
Indeed he had an impression that he had
somehow added to their peril by his indiscreet
revelations. He determined to warn them of
their danger and try to save them.</p>





<hr />


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"IN PERICULIS TUTUS."</p>

<p class="dropcap">With this purpose the young Greek assuming
his most decorous and sober
attire, proceeded to what would now be called
the bureau of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
It was situated near the Forum, in the cloister
around which were grouped the shops of the
<i>argentarii</i> and <i>mensarii</i>, or private and public
bankers of Rome. It held about the same
relation to those that the Treasury Department
at New York does to the bankers' offices and
Gold Board in Wall Street. On every side were
evidences of the concentrated wealth and power
of the august mistress of the world. A vast
granite building, as strong and solid as a prison,
was before him. Roman sentinels paced the
street, hugging the wall to share the protection
from the noontide heat offered by its grateful
shade. Convoys of specie, guarded by cohorts
of soldiers with unsheathed swords, were
continually arriving or departing. Gangs of sturdy
porters, naked to the waist, were conveying the
heavy iron-bound coffers to and from the vaults.
Officers were counting the tallies and checking
the vouchers, giving and accepting receipts.
Publicans and tax farmers of many hues and
varied garbs were there from many distant climes&mdash;the
swart Egyptian, the olive Syrian, the
graceful Greek, the pale-faced yellow-haired
German or Briton. But most prominent of all,
everywhere was seen the pushing, aggressive,
keen-eyed, hook-nosed Jew, who in every age
and every land seems to have had a genius for
finance, banking, and the handling of money.</p>

<p>From the hundred provinces of Rome the
tribute money wrung from wretched peasants,
to support Imperial luxury, to maintain the
conquering legions, to pay for the largess of corn
that fed the Roman plebs, and for the <i>fêtes</i> of
the circus that amused them, and to carry on
the vast governmental administration of the
Empire&mdash;all poured into this greatest focus of
moneyed wealth in the world. Like Daniel in
Babylon, Adauctus, the Christian, was set over
all this treasure, "because an excellent spirit was
in him, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither
was there any error or fault found in him."
The Emperors, when amid prevailing corruption,
extortion, and fraud, they found an honest servant
and able administrator, winked pretty hard at
his private opinions, so long as they did not
conflict with his duty to the State. Hence,
from the days of St. Paul, we find that enrolled
among the fellowship of Christ's Church were
"they of Cæsar's household;" and among the
epitaphs of the Catacombs we find frequent
examples of Christians of lofty rank, and holding
important offices of trust; as for instance:
"Secretary of the Patrician Order," "Sergeant of the
Exchequer," "Prefect of the City," "Ex-Quæstor
of the Sacred Palace," "Master of the Imperial
Household," and the like.</p>

<p>Making his way to the private apartment, or
office of Adauctus, the Greek found him dictating
despatches to a secretary. At a nod from his
chief, the secretary retired, and Adauctus, with
warm interest, addressed Isidorus in the words:</p>

<p>"Right welcome, after your successful quest.
You have skilfully performed a difficult task.
The Empress is greatly gratified, and you may
count your fortune as good as made."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency is too kind," replied the
Greek, with a graceful salutation; "I feel that
I do not deserve your praise."</p>

<p>"Your modesty, my friend," remarked Adauctus
with a smile, "shall not prevent your promotion,
It is too rare a gift not to be encouraged."</p>

<p>"I have come, your Excellency," said Isidorus,
with some degree of trepidation, "upon a business
that nearly concerns yourself, and some to whom
you wish well."</p>

<p>"It is very good of you," Adauctus calmly
replied, "but I do not think you can give me
any information that I do not already possess."</p>

<p>"I am in duty bound," continued the Greek,
"to reveal to your Excellency, what is a secret
which is sedulously kept from your knowledge.
You have enemies who have vowed your
destruction&mdash;the Princess Fausta, Furca, the
arch-priest of Cybele, and the Prefect Naso. They
menace also the Empresses Prisca and Valeria,
and others in high places suspected of Christianity."</p>

<p>"Is that all you can tell me?" asked Adauctus,
with a smile. "Look you," and unlocking an
ivory cabinet, he took out a wax-covered tablet
on which were inscribed the names of several
other conspirators against his life, with the
particulars of their plots.</p>

<p>"I have not sought one of these disclosures,"
he went on, "yet they have come to me from
trustworthy sources; sometimes from men who
are themselves Pagan, yet with honest souls that
recoil from treachery and murder."</p>

<p>"And you know all this and remain thus
calm!" exclaimed the Greek in amazement.</p>

<p>"With such a sword of Damocles hanging over
<i>my</i> head, I am sure I could neither eat nor
sleep."</p>

<p>"Have you never read the words," asked
Adauctus solemnly, "'The very hairs of your head
are all numbered?' and not a sparrow shall fall
without your Father's notice. Have you never
read of righteous Daniel whom his enemies cast
into the lions' den, and how God shut the lions'
mouths that they did him no harm. You have
seen the pictured story in the Catacombs. So
will my God deliver me from the mouth of
the lion," and a look of heroic faith transfigured
his face&mdash;"or," he whispered lower, but with an
expression of even more utter trust, "or give
a greater victory and take me to Himself."</p>

<p>"Such stoical philosophy, my master," said the
Greek with bated breath, "neither Zeno nor
Seneca ever taught."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the noble Roman, "it is not
stoicism, it is faith. Not in the Porch or
Academy is this holy teaching learned, but in
the school of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"Oh, wretched coward that I am!" cried the
Greek, with an impassioned aspiration after a
moral courage which he felt almost beyond his
comprehension, "would that I had such faith."</p>

<p>"Seek it, my brother," said Adauctus solemnly,
"where alone it may be found, at the Cross of
Christ. Whoso apprehends in his soul the
meaning of the Great Sacrifice, will thenceforth
count not his life dear unto him for the testimony
of Jesus."</p>

<p>"But is the way of the Cross such a thorny,
bloodstained path?" asked the Greek, with
quavering voice. "Are those noble souls, the
highborn and beautiful Valeria, the good and
gentle Callirhoë, exposed to such appalling
perils?"</p>

<p>"We live in troublous times," answered
Adauctus. "Christ came not to send peace on
the earth but a sword. Whoso will save his
life by cowardice and treachery shall basely
lose it. Whoso will lose it for Christ's sake shall
gloriously and forever find it!"</p>

<p>These words burned into the heart and brain
of the craven Greek, and he winced and shrank
beneath them as if a hot iron were searing his
quivering flesh.</p>

<p>"But we must hope for the best," went on
Adauctus more cheerfully. "We must take every
precaution. Life and liberty are glorious gifts.
We may not rashly imperil them. I trust that
our august mistress, standing so near the throne,
stands in no peculiar peril; and you may be
sure her power will be used for the protection
of her friends. So," he added with a laugh of
keen intelligence, "if thou hast any special
interest in the fair Callirhoë, be sure she enjoys
the most potent patronage in Rome."</p>

<p>"But you, take you no precaution for yourself?"
entreated the Greek. "You know not the
bitterness of the jealousy and hate of your enemies."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do," the Imperial treasurer calmly
replied, "As for me, my work is here. By
ruling righteously and dealing justly I can
prevent much fraud, and wrong, and suffering. I
can shield the innocent and frustrate the villany
of public thieves&mdash;and there are many such in
the high places of this degenerate city. Our
heroic ancestors decreed that we must never
dispair of our country. But I confess, were it
not for that salt of Christian faith that preserves
the old Roman world, I believe it would sink
into moral putrescence. It is this divine leaven
which alone can leaven the whole mass."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE MIDNIGHT PLOT.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The scene of our story is now transferred to
the Palace of the Emperor Galerius, one of
the most sumptuous of the group of marble
buildings which crowned the Palatine Hill. It
is the hour of midnight; and in one of the most
private chambers of the palace a secret
conspiracy is in progress, which has for its object
the destruction of the Christians&mdash;especially of
those high in rank and influence. The lamps in
the aula and vestibule burned dimly, and, in iron
sockets along the outside of the palace walls,
flared and smoked torches made of tow covered
with a coating of clay or plaster.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Fausta, the mother of Galerius, and Furca, the
high-priest of Cybele, were already conferring
upon their secret plot. With them was Black
Juba, who had just returned from gathering, at
"the witching hour of night," upon the unhallowed
ground set apart for the burning of the
dead, certain baleful plants&mdash;wolf's bane, bitter
briony, and aconite&mdash;which she used in wicked
spells and incantations. In her native Nubia she
had an evil reputation as a sorceress, and in Rome
she still carried on by stealth her nefarious art.
It was hinted, indeed, in the palace, that by her
subtle, deadly potions she fulfilled her own
prophecies of ill against the objects of the hatred
of her employers.</p>

<p>"'Tis certain," hissed through her teeth the
spiteful old Fausta, while murder gleamed from
her sloe-black eyes, "that Galerius will not
include in the Imperial rescript that painted doll,
Valeria. She exerts unbounded fascination over
him. It must be the spell of her false religion."</p>

<p>"The spell of her beauty and grace, rather,"
answered Furca, with a grin.</p>

<p>"What! Are you duped by her wiles, too?"
asked Fausta, with bitterness.</p>

<p>"No; I hate her all the more," said the priest;
"but I cannot close my eyes to what every one
sees."</p>

<p>"It is something that I, at least, do not see,"
muttered the withered crone, whose own harsh
features seemed the very incarnation of hatred
and cruelty. "If we cannot get rid of her under
the decree," she went on, "we can, at least, in a
surer but more perilous way. Cunning Juba,
here, has access to her person; and by her skilled
decoctions can make her beauty waste, and her
life flicker to extinction, like a lamp unreplenished
with oil."</p>

<p>"Yes, Juba has learned, in the old land of the
Nile, some of the dark secrets of Egypt,"
whispered, with bated breath, the dusky African.
"But it is very perilous to use them. The palace
is full of suspicion; and that new favourite,
Callirhoë,&mdash;how I hate her!&mdash;keeps watch over
her mistress like the wild gazelle of the desert
over its mate. It will take much gold to pay for
the risk."</p>

<p>"Gold thou shalt have to thy heart's content,
if thou do but rid me of that cockatrice, who has
usurped my place in my son's affections," hissed
the wicked woman, who still felt a fierce, tiger-like
love for the soldier-son whom she had
trained up like a tiger cub. And Juba retired, to
await further orders.</p>

<p>"But if she die thus," said Furca, with a
malignant gleam in his eyes, "she dies alone.
What we want is to have her drag others down
with her&mdash;her mother, Prisca; that haughty
Adauctus, who holds himself so high, and the rest
of the accursed Christian brood."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what we want, if it can be done,"
said Fausta; "but I fear it is impossible. You
do not know how headstrong Galerius is in his
own way; and the more he is opposed, the fiercer
he is."</p>

<p>"Here comes Naso," said the arch priest.
"He hates the Christians, if he does not love
the gods. We will hear his counsel."</p>

<p>"Welcome, good Naso," exclaimed Fausta, as
the Prefect of the city was ushered into the
room. "We need your advice in the matter of
this edict against the Christians: how we may
use it as a net to snare the higher game of the
palace and the Imperial household."</p>

<p>"We must be wary as the weasel, sleepless as
the basilisk, deadly as the aspic," said Naso,
sententiously.</p>

<p>"Just what I have been saying," remarked
Furca.</p>

<p>"Methinks we must employ the aspic's secret
sting, rather than the public edict."</p>

<p>"I declare for the edict," exclaimed with
energy the truculent Naso. "Let its thunders
smite the loftiest as well as the lowly. It will
carry greater terror, and make the ruin of the
Christian party more complete. What is the use
of lopping off the twigs, when the trunk and
main branches are unscathed? I possess proof
that will doom Adauctus, the senator Aurelius,
and others who stand higher still. The Christians
to the lions&mdash;every one, say I."</p>

<p>"And so say I," ejaculated Furca, with malicious
fervour; "but her Excellency thinks that
Galerius will interpose to protect one who stands
near the throne, though she be the chief
encouragement of the Christian vermin that crawl
at her feet."</p>

<p>"Madam, he dare not," exclaimed Naso, with
his characteristic gesture of clenching his hand as
if grasping his sword. "His own crown would
stand in peril if beneath its shadow he would
protect traitors to the State and enemies of the
gods, however high their station."</p>

<p>"As head of the State," interjected the priest,
"he is the champion of the gods, and bound to
avenge their insulted majesty."</p>

<p>"You know not what he would dare," replied
Fausta. "He would defy both gods and men, if
he took the whim."</p>

<p>"An accusation will be made before me," said
Naso, "which not even the Emperors can over-look,
against the Imperial Consort, Valeria, for
intriguing with the Christians and bringing their
priests to Rome, and conniving at their crimes
against the State. We will see whether the
majesty of the Empire or the beauty of a painted
butterfly weighs the heavier in the scales."</p>

<p>"I will second in private what your accusation
demands in public," said the implacable Fausta.
"Methinks I could die content if I might only
trample that minion under my feet."</p>

<p>"And I," said Furca, "will menace him with
the wrath of the gods if he refuse to avenge their
wrongs."</p>

<p>"Between us all," added Naso, "it will go hard
if we do not crush the Christian vermin, even
beneath the shadow of the throne."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN THE TOILS OF THE TEMPTER.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In his statement as to the accusation of the
Empress before his tribunal, Naso, after his
manner, took counsel of his truculent desires
rather than of his cool reason. He had learned
from his scapegrace son, Calphurnius, that Isidorus
had returned to town from executing a commission
for the Empress, the general purpose of
which that hopeful youth had extorted from the
drunken maunderings of the inconstant and
unhappy Greek. Naso took it for granted, from his
previous acquaintance with human nature of the
baser sort, that Isidorus was trying to serve two
masters, and that while acting as the agent of
Valeria he would be willing to betray her secrets.
Unaware of his vacillation of character and of
his transient impulses toward Christianity, he
further believed that the supple Greek, in
accordance with his compact, would act as public
accuser of the Christians. He had impressed
upon Calphurnius, who was very prompt to learn
the lesson, that it was of the utmost importance
to bring the Greek under his personal influence
and control, and especially to induce him to
come again to the tribunal of the Prefect in the
Forum.</p>

<p>"We must keep our thumb on him. We can
use him to our advantage," said the Prefect to his
son.</p>

<p>"I think I have him under a screw that will
extort from him whatever you wish," replied the
hopeful youth. "He owes me money, and he
shall pay good interest on the loan. He is not
the material of which heroes are made, like that
young Christian who suffered martyrdom, as they
call it, a few weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Well, give your screw another turn," said
Naso with a hideous chuckle. "That's the way
I do when I have them on the rack. Keep him
in debt. Lure him on. Make him lose money
at dice and lend him more. We will wring his
heart-strings by-and-bye. If we can only secure
the death of Adauctus and some of his wealthy
friends, their fair estates will help to line our
purses, for the Emperors cannot leave such a
zealous servant as the Prefect Naso unrewarded,"
and this well matched pair&mdash;the offspring of the
corruption and cruelty of the Empire&mdash;parted,
each intent on his purposes of evil.</p>

<p>The young scapegrace, Calphurnius&mdash;young in
years, but old in vice&mdash;followed only too
successfully this Satanic advice. He attached himself
closely to Isidorus and became his very shadow&mdash;his
other self. He lured him on to ostentatious
extravagance of expenditure, often allowing him
to win large sums at dice to replenish his depleted
purse, and again winning from him every sesterce,
and binding the Greek's fortunes more firmly to
his own by lending him large sums, yet demanding
usurious interest. The easy, pleasure-loving
nature of Isidorus, intent on enjoying the passing
hour and shrinking from suffering of body or
anxiety of mind, made this <i>descensus Averni</i> all
the more facile. He was thus led to forget all
his good resolutions and noble purposes, and to
plunge into the fashionable follies of the most
corrupt society in the world. From the maundering
remarks which fell from his lips in his fits of
drunkenness, for he rapidly lapsed into this
baneful vice, Calphurnius constructed a monstrous
story of treachery which he used to create an
utter rupture between the Greek and the Christians,
alleging that he had too irreparably betrayed
them to be ever forgiven, and that the
only way of escaping the doom which menaced
them was to throw himself into the arms of the
party in power. It was with feelings of horror
that in his rare moments of sober reflection
Isidorus realized how fast and how far he had
drifted from the thoughts, and feelings, and
purposes of the hour when he knelt, in the Catacomb
of Callixtus, at the feet of the good presbyter
Primitius; or since he returned from Milan the
restorer to the fair Callirhoë of her sire; or even
since, a few days before, he had conversed with
Adauctus and beheld with admiration his serenity
of spirit under the shadow of persecution and
death.</p>

<p>Calphurnius exhausted every art to wring from
his lips a legal accusation of the Christians, for
even the ruthless persecutors wished to observe
some forms of law in the destruction of their
destined victims.</p>

<p>"You have already betrayed them beyond
reparation," he said, "and you may as well
obtain the reward. You have told all about
your employment by Adauctus in a treasonable
mission to the Christian sectaries at Ravenna
and Milan. You have been present at their
assemblies at the Villa Marcella and in the
Catacombs. A short hand notary<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> has taken
down every word you said, and it shall be used
against you unless you turn evidence for the
State, and save yourself by bringing its enemies
to justice."</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried the exasperated Greek.
"Cease to torment me! 'Tis you who have
tempted me to this perfidy, and now you seek
to goad me to perdition. The Christians are no
traitors to the State, and you know it."</p>

<p>"The edict of the Emperors declares that they
are," said Calphurnius, with a sneer, "perhaps
you can persuade their Divine Majesties that
they are mistaken."</p>

<p>"What would you? What further infamy
would you have me commit?" exclaimed the
tortured Isidorus.</p>

<p>"Only declare before the Prefect what you
have already divulged to me. By refusing you
only imperil yourself," replied his tormentor.</p>

<p>"I consent," moaned the craven-hearted Greek,
and he went on with a shudder, "I am double-dyed
in infamy already. I can acquire no deeper
stain."</p>

<p>"'Tut, man! don't be a fool! Rome can pay
her servants well. You will soon be well
rewarded," and like an incarnate Diabolus, the
accuser of the brethren proceeded to earn, as
another Judas, the wages of iniquity by betraying
innocent blood.</p>

<p class="center">THE PLOT THICKENS.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Isidorus reluctantly accompanied Calphurnius
to the tribunal of the Prefect;
and there, partly through intimidation, partly
through cajolery, he gave such information as to
his expedition to Ravenna and Milan as the
Prefect chose to ask. This was tortured, by that
unscrupulous officer, into an accusation against
the Empress Valeria of conspiracy with the
Chancellor, Adauctus, and others of the Christian
sect, against the worship of the gods of Rome,
and so, constructively, of treason against the
State. This indictment&mdash;<i>accusatio</i>, as it was
technically called was duly formulated, and
attested under the seal of the Prefect's Court.
Naso, the Prefect, and Furca, the priest, found a
congenial task in submitting the document to
the Emperor Galerius, and asking his authority
to proceed against the accused. They visited the
palace at an hour when it had been arranged
that the Emperor's evil genius, the cruel Fausta,
should be with him, to exert her malign influence
in procuring the downfall of the object of her
malice&mdash;the Empress Valeria&mdash;and the destruction
of the Christian sect. "The insulted gods
appeal to your Divine Majesty for protection,
and for the punishment of the atheists who
despise their worship and defy their power," began
the high-priest of Cybele, seeking to work upon
the superstition of the Illyrian herdsman, raised
to the Imperial purple.</p>

<p>"Well, my worthy friend," replied the Emperor
in a bantering tone, "what is the matter now.
Has any one been poaching on your preserves?"</p>

<p>"This is not a matter of private concern, Your
Majesty," remarked the Prefect gravely. "It
touches the welfare of the State and the stability
of your throne."</p>

<p>"Yes, and your personal and domestic honour,
too," whispered Fausta in his ear.</p>

<p>"It must be something pretty comprehensive
to do all that. Come, out with it at once," laughed
the Emperor.</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Furca began to recount the
insults offered to the gods by the Christians, and,
especially, that the Empress no longer attended
their public festivals.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I understand," said the Emperor, with
a yawn, "your craft is in danger. The offerings
at your altars are falling off; and we all know
where <i>they</i> went. The gods are all alike to me;
I believe in none of them."</p>

<p>"But they are necessary, to keep the mob in
subjection," said Naso. "Some are amused with
their pageants, and others are awed by menaces
of their wrath."</p>

<p>"Yes, I grant you, they are of some use for
that; and that is all they are good for," replied
this ancient Agnostic.</p>

<p>"But the Christians are traitors to the State,"
continued the Prefect; "rank sedition-mongers.
They are secretly sworn to serve another Lord
than the Cæsars, and they are ceaselessly striving
to undermine your Imperial Majesty's authority."</p>

<p>"You do well," continued the cruel Galerius,
a fire of deadly hate burning in his eyes, "to
exterminate that accursed vermin, wherever
found. Burn, crucify, torture, as you will."</p>

<p>"And the estates of the rebels, they escheat to
the temples of the insulted gods?" asked the
priest, with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>"Nay, to the State, I think," laughed the
Emperor. "Is it not so, good Naso?"</p>

<p>"Half to the State and half to the <i>delator</i>,
or accuser," answered that worthy, learned in the
law of pillage.</p>

<p>"Let not the wolves fall out about the prey,"
said the Emperor, with a sneer; "only make sure
work."</p>

<p>"Be so good then, Your Majesty, as to affix
your seal to these decrees of death. With such
high officers as Adauctus and Aurelius my
authority as Prefect is not sufficient."</p>

<p>"And the Empress Valeria; she, too, as traitor
to your person and crown, is included in the
decree," insinuated, in a wheedling tone, the
crafty priest.</p>

<p>"Base hound," roared the Emperor, laying his
hand upon his sword; "breathe but the name of
the Empress again, and I will pluck thy vile
tongue from thy throat."</p>

<p>"Nay, Your Majesty," said the crafty Fausta,
while the abject priest cowered like a whipped
cur; "'tis but his excess of zeal for Your
Majesty's honour, which I fear the Empress
betrays."</p>

<p>"Madam," said Galerius, sternly, "I am the
guardian of my own honour. What the Christians
are, I neither know nor care. What the
Empress is, I know&mdash;the noblest soul that
breathes in Rome. Who wags his tongue against
her shall be given to the crows and kites. <i>Dixi
Fiat</i>&mdash;I have spoken&mdash;so let it be," and his
terrible frown, as he stalked from the room,
showed that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>The three conspirators, for a moment, stared at
each other in consternation. Then the wily
Fausta faltered out, "Said I not, he would defy
both gods and men? We must do by stealth
what we cannot do by force. Juba must ply her
most secret and most deadly arts. I have certain
subtle spells myself; and if mortal hate can give
them power, I will make her beauty waste away
like a fading flower, and her strength wane like a
dying lamp."</p>

<p>"'Tis a dangerous game," replied Naso. "Be
wary how you play it. As for me, armed with
this edict, I will strike at mine ancient foe, for
whom I long have nursed a bitter spite. Curse
him! I am tired of hearing him called Adauctus
the Just. He held me to such a strict account
that I had to make a full return of all the fines
and mulcts paid in, without taking the toll which
is my right." And he departed to gratify his
double passion of revenge and greed.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that such a truculent
monster as Galerius, of whom, in his later days,
his Christian subjects were wont to say that "he
never supped without human blood&mdash;<i>Nec unquam
sine cruore humano c&#339;nabat,</i>"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>&mdash;should be so
under the spell of his Christian wife. But the
statement is corroborated by the records of
history, and by the philosophy of the human mind.
There is a power in moral goodness that can awe
the rudest natures, a winsome spell that can subdue
the hardest hearts. It was the story of Una
and the Lion, of Beauty and the Beast over again;
and one of the severest trials for a Christian
wife in those days of the struggle between
Christianity and Paganism for the mastery of the
world, was that of being allied to a pagan
husband. Tertullian, in the third century, thus
describes the difficulties which a Christian woman
married to an idolater must encounter in her
religious life:</p>

<p>"At the time for worship the husband will
appoint the use of the bath; when a fast is to be
observed he will invite company to a feast
When she would bestow alms, both safe and
cellar are closed against her. What heathen will
suffer his wife to attend the nightly meetings of
the Church, the slandered Supper of the Lord, to
visit the sick even in the poorest hovels, to kiss
the martyrs' chains in prison, to rise in the night
for prayer, to show hospitality to stranger
brethren?"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In time of persecution, or in the case of
persons of such exalted rank as that of Valeria, the
difficulty of adorning a Christian life, amid their
pagan surroundings, was all the greater. Yet not
a word of scandal has been breathed upon the
character of the wife of the arch persecutor of
the Christians; and even the sneering pen of
Gibbon has only words of commendation for the
Christian Empress who herself under subsequent
persecution, remained steadfast even unto death.</p>

<p>The beauty and dignity of Christian wedlock
in an age of persecution and strife are nobly
expressed by Tertullian in the following passage,
addressed to his own wife: "How can I paint the
happiness," he exclaims, "of a marriage which
the Church ratines, the Sacrament confirms, the
benediction seals, angels announce, and our
heavenly Father declares valid! What a union
of two believers&mdash;one hope, one vow, one
discipline, one worship! They are brother and sister,
two fellow-servants, one spirit and one flesh.
They pray together, fast together, exhort and
support one another. They go together to the
house of God, and to the table of the Lord.
They share each other's trials, persecutions, and
joys. Neither avoids, nor hides anything from
the other. They delight to visit the sick, succour
the needy, and daily to lay their offerings before
the altar without scruple, and without constraint.
They do not need to keep the sign of the cross
hidden, nor to express secretly their Christian
joy, nor to receive by stealth the eucharist. They
join in psalms and hymns, and strive who best
can praise God. Christ rejoices at the sight, and
sends His peace upon them. Where two are in
His name He also is; and where He is, there evil
cannot come."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A CRIME PREVENTED.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The deadly malice of Fausta, Furca, and Naso
towards the Empress Valeria, foiled in its
attempt to invoke upon her the penalties of the
edict against the Christians, sought, by secret
means, to procure her death. Juba, the black
slave, was heavily bribed to prepare some of her
most subtle poisons and procure their administration.
But here a difficulty presented itself,
and it is a striking illustration of the corruption
of the Empire and of the daily peril in which the
inhabitants of the Imperial palace dwelt&mdash;a state
of peril which finds its modern analogue only
in the continual menace under which the Czar
of all the Russias lives, with a sword of Damocles
suspended by a single hair above his head. Such
was the atmosphere of suspicion which pervaded
the whole palace, such the dread of assassination
or of poisoning, that trusty guards and
officers swarmed in the ante-chambers and
prevented access to the members of the Imperial
family except under the most rigid precautions
of safety; and a special officer was appointed,
whose duty, as his title of <i>Prægustalor</i> implies,
was to taste every kind of food or drink provided
for the Imperial table. Regard for his
personal safety was, of course, a guarantee that
the utmost precautions were observed in preparing
the daily food of the Imperial household. Juba
in vain attempted to bribe some of the kitchen
scullions and cooks to mix with the savoury
viands designed for the use of Valeria, who
generally lunched in her private apartments, a potent
poison. They accepted, indeed, her bribes, but
prudently declined to carry out their part of the
agreement, well knowing that she dare not venture
to criminate herself by an open rupture with
them.</p>

<p>At length she resolved on attempting a more
subtle but less certain mode of administering a
deadly drug. While in the service of a priest of
Isis in Egypt, she had extorted or cajoled from
an Abyssinian slave in his service certain dark
secrets, learned it was said by the Queen of Sheba
from Solomon, and handed down from age to age
as the esoteric lore of the realm. One of these
was the preparation of a volatile poison so subtle
and powerful that its mere inhalation was of
deadly potency. As a means of conveying this
to her victim, and at the same time of disguising
the pungent aromatic odour, a basket of flowers
which she had plentifully sprinkled with the
deadly poison was sent to the Empress. To make
assurance doubly sure, she concealed among the
flowers one of those beautiful but deadly asps,
such as that from the bite of which the dusky
Queen of Egypt, the wanton Cleopatra, died.
This, for purposes connected with her nefarious
arts, she had procured as what evil thing could
not be procured?&mdash;from the dealers in deadly
drugs, philtres, and potions in the crowded Ghetto
of Rome.</p>

<p>To ensure the conveyance of the deadly gift
to the hands of Valeria herself, Juba invented
the fiction that they were a thankoffering from
the young Greek, Isidorus, to his Imperial
patroness for favours received. With her
characteristic cunning Juba had possessed herself of
the secret of his services rendered to the Empress,
and of the interest felt in him by her august
mistress.</p>

<p>Valeria was in her <i>boudoir</i> with her favourite
and now inseparable Callirhoë, as her tire woman,
dressing her hair, when the fatal missive arrived.
As Callirhoë received the basket from the hands
of Juba, the eyes of the slave gleamed with the
deadly hate of a basilisk, and she muttered as she
turned away&mdash;</p>

<p>"May the curse of Isis rest on them both. My
fine lady has driven black Juba from the tiring
room of the Empress. May she now share her
fate," and, like a sable Atropos, she glided from
the chamber with stealthy and cat-like tread.</p>

<p>"Oh! what fresh and fragrant flowers,"
exclaimed the Empress Valeria, as she bent over
them, "see how the dew is yet fresh upon their
petals." Here she raised the basket so as more
fully to inhale their fragrance. At that moment
the concealed and deadly asp whose dark green
and glossy skin had prevented its detection among
the acanthus and lily leaves, seized, with his
envenomed fang, the damask cheek of the fair
Valeria, and for a moment clung firmly there.</p>

<p>"God, save her!" exclaimed Callirhoë, who
in a moment recognized the cruel aspic, of which,
as a child, she had been often warned in her
native Antioch, and with an eager gesture she
flung the venomous reptile to the ground and
crushed its head beneath her sandal's heel. On
the quick instinct of the moment and without
stopping to think of the consequences to herself,
she threw her arms about her Imperial mistress'
neck, and pressing her lips to her cheek, sucked
the venom from the yet bleeding wound.</p>

<p>The cry of the Empress as the little serpent
stung her cheek brought a swarm of attendants
and slaves into the room, among them black Juba
and the officer of the guard who was responsible
for the Empress' safety. Valeria had fainted and
lay pale as ashes on her couch, a crimson stream
flowing from her cheek.</p>

<p>"Dear heart!" exclaimed Juba, with an
ostentatious exhibition of well-feigned grief, "let her
inhale this fragrant elixir. It is a potent
restorative in such deadly faints," and she attempted to
complete her desperate crime by thrusting the
poisonous perfume under Valeria's nostrils.</p>

<p>"Who was last in the presence before this
strange accident&mdash;if it be an accident&mdash;occurred?"
demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"I and Juba, were the only ones," faltered
Callirhoë, when a deathly pallor passed over her
face, and with a convulsive shudder she fell
writhing on the ground.</p>

<p>"You are under arrest," said the officer to.
Juba, and then to a soldier of the guard, "Go,
seize and seal up her effects&mdash;everything she has;
and you," turning to another, "send at once the
court physician."</p>

<p>The attendants meanwhile were fanning and
sprinkling with water the seemingly inanimate
forms of the Empress and Callirhoë. When the
physician came and felt the fluttering pulse and
noted the dilated eyes of his patients, he
pronounced it a case of acrid poisoning and promptly
ordered antidotes. The Empress, in a few days
rallied and seemed little the worse beyond a
strange pallor which overspread her features and
an abnormal coldness, almost as of death, which
pervaded her frame. From these she never fully
recovered, but throughout her life was known in
popular speech as "The White Lady."</p>

<p>Upon Callirhoë the effects of the poison were
still more serious. By her prompt action in
sucking the aspic virus from the envenomed
wound, she had saved the life of her beloved
mistress, but at the peril of her own. The venom
coursed through her veins, kindling the fires of
fever in her blood. Her dilated eyes shone with
unusual brilliance; her speech was rapid; her
manner urgent; and her emotions and expressions
were characterized by a strange and unwonted
intenseness. The physician in answer to
the eager questioning of Valeria, gravely shook
his head, and said that the case was one that
baffled his skill&mdash;that cure there was none for
the aspic's poison if absorbed into the system,
although as it had not in this case been
communicated directly to the blood, possibly the
youth and vigour of the patient might overcome
the toxic effect of the contagium&mdash;so he
learnedly discoursed.</p>

<p>"My dear child, you have given your life for
mine," exclaimed the Empress, throwing her arms
around her late enfranchised slave, and bedewing
her cheek with her tears.</p>

<p>"God grant it be so," said Callirhoë, with
kindling eye. "I would gladly die to save you
from a sorrow or a pain. I owe you more than
life. I owe you liberty and a life more precious
than my own."</p>

<p>"All that love and skill can do, dear heart, shall
be done," said the Empress caressingly, "to
preserve you to your new-found liberty, and to your
sire."</p>

<p>"As God wills, dearest lady," answered
Callirhoë, kissing her mistress' hand. "In His great
love I live or die content. I bless Him every
hour that He has permitted me to show in some
weak way, the love I bear my best and dearest
earthly friend."</p>

<p>And with such fond converse passed the hours
of Valeria's convalescence, and of Callirhoë's
deepening decline.</p>





<hr />


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE STORM BURSTS.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The crafty Juba, when she found herself
arrested in <i>flagrante delicto</i>&mdash;in the very
act of her attempted crime&mdash;determined to use,
if possible, the fiction she had employed with
reference to Isidorus, as a means of escape from
the very serious dilemma in which she was placed.
It will be remembered that she had stated, in order
to procure the acceptance of her fatal gift, that
it was a thank-offering from the young Greek
who had rendered such service to the Empress
and Callirhoë. Happy if Valeria had remembered
and practised the ancient adage, "<i>Timeo
Danaos et dona ferentes.</i>" But suspicion was
foreign to her generous nature, and even if the
wise saw had occurred to her, she would have
lightly laughed away its cynical suggestion.</p>

<p>When the treacherous slave was examined as
to her share in the attempted crime, she stoutly
adhered to her fictitious story, and protested that
she knew nothing of the contents of the basket,
but that she had received it from Isidorus, and
had been well paid for conveying it to the
Empress without suspicion of any sinister design.</p>

<p>The Greek, when charged with the crime of
attempting to procure, by poison, the death of the
Empress Valeria, manifested the greatest astonishment.
Summoned before the Quæstor of the
Palace, an officer of co-ordinate jurisdiction with
the Prefect of the city, he stoutly protested his
innocence. But all his protestations were
regarded by that official, as only the very
perfection of art&mdash;the well-feigned evasions of a
mendacious Greek. And certainly appearances
were very much against him. The Prefect Naso,
now that he had extorted from him all the
information he had to give, abandoned him as a
worn-out tool and divulged to the Quæstor the damning
fact that the Greek by a formal document had
accused the Empress of treason against the State,
and of conspiracy with the Christians&mdash;for so
he represented the confessions which, by his
diabolical arts, he had wrung from his unhappy
victim. Confronted by this evidence Isidorus
was dumb. He saw the trap into which he had
been snared, and that by no efforts of his own
could he extricate himself. He saw, too, the ruin
he had brought upon his friends, for Naso had
procured the immediate arrest of Adauctus,
Aurelius, and Demetrius, the father of Callirhoë,
and other Christians connected with the Imperial
household. Callirhoë herself was also placed
under arrest, upon the monstrous accusation of
conspiracy with Isidorus and Juba to procure
the death of the Empress Valeria. One would
have thought that her self-devotion and almost
sacrifice of her life to save that of her mistress
would have been a sufficient vindication from
such a charge. But the unreasoning terror of
the Emperors and the unreasoning hatred of all
who bore the Christian name, fostered as these
were by the machinations and evil suggestions of
the Quæstor of the Palace, the Prefect of the
city, the arch priest of Cybele, and the cruel,
crafty Fausta, thirsty for the blood of her victim,
rendered possible the acceptance of any charge,
however improbable. "Any stick will do to beat
a dog," and any accusation, however absurd, was
considered available against the Christians.</p>

<p>Even Galerius who, left to himself, would,
soldier-like, have braved any personal danger,
completely lost his judgment at the peril
menacing the Empress. The tortures of slaves and
servants by the perverted tribunals, miscalled of
justice, fomented by the cruel, crafty priests, and
the eager greed of Prefect and Quæstor, caused
an outburst of persecution against all who bore
the Christian name. The estates of Adauctus,
and Aurelius were expropriated by the persecutors,
and as a consequence their late possessors
were pre-judged to death. Valeria who would
fain have interposed her protection, had suffered
such a physical shock as to be incapable of
exercising any authority or influence she might possess.
And the Empress Prisca, less courageous in spirit,
less beautiful in person, and less potent in
influence, was completely cowed by the domineering
violence of the Emperor Diocletian, who was
quite beside himself at the conspiracy against the
gods, and against the Imperial Household which
he persuaded himself had been discovered.</p>

<p>"Madam," he replied, in answer to a weak
remonstrance against the persecution, "was it not
enough that our palace at Nicomedia was burned
over our heads, that you must apologise for
treason in our very household and the menace of
our very person. No; the Christian superstition
must be stamped out, and the worship of the
gods maintained."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Hence throughout the wide empire, in the sober
language of history, "Edict followed edict, rising
in regular gradations of angry barbarity. The
whole clergy were declared enemies of the State;
and bishops, presbyters, and deacons were crowded
into the prisons intended for the basest malefactors"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>&mdash;"an
innumerable company," says the
Christian bishop Eusebius, "so that there was
no room left for those condemned for crime."
"We saw with our own eyes," writes a contemporary
historian, "our houses of worship thrown
down, the sacred Scriptures committed to the
flames, and the shepherds of the people become
the sport of their enemies&mdash;scourge with rods,
tormented with the rack and excruciating
scrapings, in which some endured the most
terrible death. Then men and women, with a
certain divine and inexpressible alacrity rushed
into the fire. The persecutors, constantly
inventing new tortures, vied with one another as if
there were prizes offered to him who should
invent the greatest cruelties. The men bore fire,
sword, and crucifixions, savage beasts, and the
depths of the sea, the maiming of limbs and
searing with red hot iron, digging out of the eyes
and mutilations of the whole body, also hunger,
the mines, and prison. The women also were
strengthened by the Divine Word, so that some
of them endured the same trials as the men, and
bore away the same prize. It would exceed all
powers of detail," he goes on, "to give an idea
of the sufferings and tortures which the martyrs
endured. And these things were done, not for
a few days, but for a series of whole years. We
ourselves," he adds, "have seen crowds of persons,
some beheaded, some burned alive, in a single
day, so that the murderous weapons were blunted
and broken in pieces, and the executioners, weary
with slaughter, were obliged to give over the
work of blood."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And he goes on to describe
deeds of shame and torture of which he was
an eye-witness, which our pen refuses to record.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm for martyrdom prevailed at
times almost like an epidemic. It was one of
the most remarkable features of the ages of
persecution. Notwithstanding the terrific
tortures to which they were exposed, the zeal of the
Christian heroes burned higher and brighter in
the fiercest tempest of heathen rage. Age after
age summoned the soldiers of the Cross to the
conflict whose highest guerdon was death. They
bound persecution as a wreath about their brows,
and exulted in the "glorious infamy" of
suffering for their Lord. The brand of shame
became the badge of highest honour. Besides
the joys of heaven they won imperishable fame
on earth; and the memory of a humble slave was
often haloed with a glory surpassing that of a
Curtius or Horatius. The meanest hind was
ennobled by the accolade of martyrdom to the
loftiest peerage of the skies. His consecration
of suffering was elevated to a sacrament, and
called the baptism of fire or of blood.</p>

<p>Burning to obtain the prize, the impetuous
candidates for death often pressed with eager
haste to seize the palm of victory and the
martyr's crown. They trod with joy the fiery
path to glory, and went as gladly to the stake as
to a marriage feast. "Their fetters," says
Eusebius, "seemed like the golden ornaments of a
bride."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> They desired martyrdom more ardently
than men afterward sought a bishopric.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> They
exulted amid their keenest pangs that they were
counted worthy to suffer for their divine Master.
"Let the ungulæ tear us," exclaims Tertullian;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
"the crosses bear our weight, the flames envelope
us, the sword divide our throats, the wild beasts
spring upon us; the very posture of prayer is a
preparation for every punishment." "These
things," says St. Basil, "so far from being a terror,
are rather a pleasure and a recreation to us."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
"The tyrants were armed;" says St. Chrysostom;
"and the martyrs naked; yet they that were
naked got the victory, and they that carried arms
were vanquished."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Strong in the assurance of
immortality, they bade defiance to the sword.</p>

<p>Though weak in body they seemed clothed
with vicarious strength, and confident that though
"counted as sheep for the slaughter," naught
could separate them from the love of Christ.
Wrapped in their fiery vesture and shroud of
flame, they yet exulted in their glorious victory.
While the leaden hail fell on the mangled frame,
and the eyes filmed with the shadows of death,
the spirit was enbraved by the beatific vision of
the opening heaven, and above the roar of the
mob fell sweetly on the inner sense the assurance
of eternal life. "No group, indeed, of Oceanides
was there to console the Christian Prometheus;
yet to his upturned eye countless angels were
visible&mdash;their anthem swept solemnly to his ear
&mdash;and the odours of an opening paradise filled the
air. Though the dull ear of sense heard nothing,

<p>This spirit of martyrdom was a new principle
in society. It had no classical counterpart.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Socrates and Seneca suffered with fortitude, but
not with faith. The loftiest pagan philosophy
dwindled into insignificance before the sublimity
of Christian hope. This looked beyond the
shadows of time and the sordid cares of earth
to the grandeur of the Infinite and the Eternal.
The heroic deaths of the believers exhibited a
spiritual power mightier than the primal
instincts of nature, the love of wife or child, or
even of life itself. Like a solemn voice falling
on the dull ear of mankind, these holy examples
urged the inquiry, "What shall it profit a man
if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"
And that voice awakened an echo in full many a
heart. The martyrs made more converts by their
deaths than in their lives. "Kill us, rack us
condemn us, grind us to powder," exclaims the
intrepid Christian Apologist; "our numbers
increase in proportion as you mow us down."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The
earth was drunk with the blood of the saints, but
still they multiplied and grew, gloriously
illustrating the perennial truth&mdash;<i>Sanguis martyrum
semen ecclesiæ</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE MAMERTINE PRISON.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Let us now turn our attention to the fate of the
characters in our tale of Christian trial and
triumph, around whom its interest chiefly centres.
They have been consigned to one of the most
dismal of the many gloomy dungeons of Rome&mdash;the
thrice terrible Mamertine prison&mdash;haunted
with memories of long centuries of cruelty and
crime. Manacled each to a Roman soldier,
Adauctus, Aurelius, Demetrius, and Callirhoë,
together with other Christians condemned to
martyrdom, marched through the streets under
the noontide glare of a torrid sun. A guard
armed <i>cap à pié</i>, flung open an iron-studded door,
and admitted them to a gloomy vault a few steps
below the level of the street. Here a brawny
Vulcan, with anvil and hammer, with many a
brutal gibe smote off the fetters that linked the
prisoners and soldiers together, and riveted them
again so that these victims of oppression were
bound together in pairs. Sometimes it happened
that one of a pair thus bound together died, and
the survivor endured the horror of being
inseparably fettered to a festering corpse. To this
the apostle refers when, groaning over the
corruptions of his sinful nature, he exclaims: "O
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?"</p>

<p>"My dainty lady," said the hideous Cyclops,
as he rudely seized the arm of Callirhoë, "this
is not the sort of bracelet you've been used to
wear. I should not much mind, being bound to
such as you myself, only I would prefer silken
fetters to those iron gyves." Then, as she shrank
from his touch and winced as he bruised her
tender flesh in unriveting the fetters, he said,
with an insolent jeer, "I wont hurt you more
than I can help, my beauty. You are not used
to having such a rough chamberlain;" and he
uttered a coarse jest with which we shall not
pollute our page.</p>

<p>A rosy flush stormed the brow of the maiden
as she turned her blushing cheek to the mildewed
and cold stone wall, in haughty silence disdaining
a word of reply to the brutal ruffian.</p>

<p>"Nay, my fine gentlemen," went on this typical
Roman jailer, as Adauctus and the aged
Demetrius, weary with their march, sank upon a stone
bench, "this is too luxurious an apartment for
you. For you we have a deeper depth." And
Be pointed to an opening in the floor, hitherto
unnoticed in the gloom. "Nay, you need not
shrink, old man," he went on, as Demetrius
recoiled from the grave-like opening at his feet.
"Your betters have been there before you."</p>

<p>"Father, your blessing e'er you go," exclaimed
Callirhoë, and flinging herself on his breast, she
received his kiss and benediction.</p>

<p>By means of a leathern strap beneath their
arms, the prisoners were one by one let down into
a hideous vault, like men to a living burial. Into
this lower dungeon no beam of light struggled,
save a precarious ray from the opening in the
floor above. The loathsome cell was even then
dank with the slime of well-nigh a thousand
years, its construction being attributed to Ancus
Martius, the fourth king of Rome. Here the
African prince, Jugurtha, was starved to death.
"What a cold bath is this!" he exclaimed, as he
descended into its chilly gloom. Here the Gallic
king, Vercingetorix, also died. Here the usurper
Sejanus was executed, and here the fellow
conspirators of Cataline lingered to death. If we
would accept Roman tradition, we would also
believe that St. Peter and St. Paul were immured
in this dismal vault, and in the case of the latter
illustrious martyr it is more than likely that the
story is true. A stairway has now been
constructed to this lower depth, and the present
writer has stood upon the stone pavement worn
by the feet of generations of victims of
oppression, and has drunk of a spring at which the
Apostle of the Gentiles may have quenched his
thirst.</p>

<p>The prisoners enjoyed not long even this sad
reprieve from death. They were destined soon
to finish their course by a glorious martyrdom.
The Emperors determined to gratify at once their
own persecuting fury and the cruel thirst for
blood of the Roman mob, by offering a holocaust
of victims in the amphitheatre. The <i>Acta Diurna</i>,
a sort of public gazette of the day, which
circulated in the great houses, and baths, and other
places of concourse, contained the announcement
of a grand exhibition of the <i>ludi circenses</i>, or
gladiatorial games, to be celebrated in honour of
the god Neptune&mdash;<i>Neptunus Equestris</i>. In the
public spaces of the Forum, and in the
neighbourhood of the Flavian Amphitheatre and elsewhere,
where the crowd around them would not obstruct
the highway, were displayed large white bulletin
boards, on which were written in coloured chalks
a list of the games&mdash;like the playbills which
placard the streets of great cities to-day&mdash;and
heralds proclaimed through every street, even in
the crowded Ghetto, the splendour of the
approaching games. These were on a scale on which
no modern manager ever dreamed. Trajan
exhibited games which lasted a hundred and twenty-three
days, in which 10,000 gladiators fought and
11,000 fierce animals were killed. Sometimes
the vast arena was flooded with water, and
<i>naumachia</i> or sea-fights were exhibited. The vast
flood-gates and cisterns by which this was
accomplished may still be seen.</p>

<p>The chief attraction of the games provided by
the Emperors Diocletian and Galerius, however,
was not the conflict of what might almost be
called armies of trained gladiators, nor the
slaughter of hundreds of fierce Libyan leopards
and Numidian lions, but the sacrifice of some
scores of helpless and unarmed Christians&mdash;old
men, weak women, and tender and innocent
children.</p>

<p>There was much excitement in the schools of
the gladiators&mdash;vast stone barracks, where they
were drilled in their dreadful trade. They were
originally captives taken in war, or condemned
malefactors; but in the degenerate days of the
Empire, knights, senators, and soldiers sought
distinction in the arena, and even unsexed women
fought half-naked in the ring, or lay dead and
trampled in the sands. To captives of war was
often offered, as a reward for special skill or
courage, their freedom and fierce and fell were
conflicts to which men wore spurred by the double
incentives of life and liberty.</p>

<p>Special interest was given to the forthcoming
games by the distinguished reputation of one of
the volunteer gladiators, a brilliant young military
officer, our friend Ligurius Rufus, who, sated and
sickened with the most frenzied dissipations that
Rome could offer, plunged into this mimic war to
appease by its excitement the gnawing ennui of
his life.</p>

<p>The bets ran high upon the reckless young
noble who was the favourite of the sporting
spend-thrifts and profligates of the city. The vilest
condition of society that ever cursed the earth
was filling up the measure of its iniquity, and
invoking the wrath of Heaven. The wine shops
in the Suburra and the gladiators' quarter were
overflowing with a brawling, blaspheming, drunken
mob, the vilest dregs of the vilest city the patient
earth has ever borne upon its bosom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE EVE OF MARTYRDOM.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Far different was the scene presented by
another spot not far distant&mdash;a vaulted chamber
beneath the stone seats of the Coliseum, whither
the destined Christian martyrs had been removed
on the eve before the day of their triumph. As
an act of grace, some coarse straw, the refuse of
a lion's lair, had been given them, and the relief
to their fetter-cramped limbs, stiffened with lying
on a rough stone floor, was in itself an indescribable
delight. But they had a deeper cause of joy.
They were found worthy to witness a good
confession for Christ before Cæsar, like the beloved
Apostle Paul; and even as their Lord Himself
before Pontius Pilate. And now the day of their
espousals to their Heavenly Bridegroom was at
hand.</p>

<p>The silvery-haired Demetrius, a holy calm
beaming in his eyes, uttered words of peace and
comfort. The coarse black barley-bread and muddy
wine which had been given them lest death should
cheat the mob of their promised delight on the
morrow, the venerable priest had consecrated to
the Supper of the Lord&mdash;the last viaticum to
strengthen their souls on their journey to the
spirit world. Sitting at his feet, faint and wan,
but with a look of utter content upon her face,
was his daughter Callirhoë, a heavenly smile
flickering about her lips. With an undaunted
courage, a heroic resolve beaming from his eyes,
stood Adauctus, waiting, like a valiant soldier at
his post, the welcome word of the great Captain
of his salvation: "Well done! good and faithful
servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."</p>

<p>Ever and anon the deep-mouthed roar of a
hungry lion rent the air, his fierce bound shook
the walls of his cage, and his hot breath came
through the bars as he keenly sniffed the smell
of human flesh. But though it caused at times
a tremor of the quivering nerves of the wan and
wasted girl, it shook not her unfaltering soul
Listen to the holy words calmly spoken by the
venerable Demetrius: "'<i>Non turbetur cor vestrum</i>&mdash;Let
not your heart be troubled. In my Father's
house are many mansions. I go to prepare a
place for you.' Yes, daughter. Yes, brave friend;
before another sun shall set we shall see the King
in His beauty, and the laud that is very far off.
Mine aged eyes shall see, too, the beloved Rachel
of my youth, to behold whom they have ached
these many years. And thou, child, shalt see
the mother after whom thy heart hath yearned."</p>

<p>"If only, dear father, my brother Ezra were
with us," whispered Callirhoë, "we soon would
be an unbroken family in the city of the great
King."</p>

<p>"God's will be done, my child," answered the
patriarch. "He doeth all things well. He could
bid His angels fly swiftly, and shut the lions'
mouths, or better still, convoy our spirits to the
marriage supper of the Lamb&mdash;to the repose of
Abraham's bosom. Your brother is a child of the
covenant, an heir of the promises, the son of
many prayers. God will count him also in the
day when He maketh up His jewels." Then,
as if gifted with the spirit of prophecy, he
exclaimed: "Not always shall the servants of
the Most High be persecuted unto death. But
this very structure, now dedicated to slaughter
and cruelty, shall hereafter be consecrated to the
service of the true God"&mdash;a prediction which,
after long centuries, has been literally fulfilled.</p>

<p>Thus in holy converse wore the hours away.
And then through the rocky vaults of the Coliseum
stole the sweet accents of their last evening
hymn before they should sing the song of Moses
and the Lamb on high:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the
Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the
Almighty."</p>

<p>"I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and
my fortress, my God, in Him will I trust."</p>

<p>"He shall give His angels charge over thee,
to keep thee in all thy ways."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder;
the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample
under foot."</p>

<p>As this pæan of triumph swelled into louder
strain, the gladiators, awed by its strange power,
paused amid their ribald jests, and even the lion
hushed his hungry roar, and the tiger his angry
growl.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

<p class="center">A ROMAN HOLIDAY.</p>


<p class="dropcap">Early next morning the army of slaves whO
had charge of the Coliseum, under the
direction of Fulvus, the freedman, were hard at
work. Some at the very summit of the building,
with much shouting and pulling of ropes, were
stretching the great <i>velarium</i> or awning, as a
protection from the rays of the sun. Others were
sweeping the sand of the arena to a smooth and
even surface. Many cart loads of fresh sand were
heaped around the base of the podium, for the
ghastly purpose of being spread upon the blood-stained
surface after each act of the sanguinary
drama of the day. Others were decorating with
garlands of flowers, and with gold and purple
bannerets, the seats of the Emperors Diocletian
and Galerius, and those of the senators and other
persons of distinction. The great structure seemed
even more striking in its vastness, as a few score
figures crawled like flies over its empty seats,
than when filled with its tumultuous throng of
spectators. It was an immense oval six hundred
and fifteen feet in its longer diameter, and five
hundred and ten feet in the shorter. The circling
seats rose tier on tier to the giddy height of one
hundred and fifty feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/valeriamartyrofc00withiala_0200.png" width="600" height="332" alt="Interior of the Coliseum, Rome." />
<span class="caption">Interior of the Coliseum, Rome.</span>
</div>

<p>As the present writer climbed those cliff-like
walls, now crumbling into ruin, he tried to
re-people those long-deserted seats with the eager
and excited throngs which had often filled them
to overflowing, when twice eighty thousand cruel
eyes were wont to gloat upon the dying martyr's
pang, "butchered to make a Roman holiday."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Then he wandered through the vast vaulted
corridors and stairways, eighty in number, and
bearing still the old Roman numerals by which
access was gained to the different galleries. These
were so capacious that the whole multitude could
in a few minutes disperse, and were thence called
<i>vomitoria</i>. He then explored the dens and caves
for the wild beasts, and the rocky chambers in
which the gladiators and martyr victims awaited
the signal that called them to their doom. The
row of seats just above the podium was reserved
for the equestrian order; those higher still, for
the <i>populus</i>, or common people; and the highest
of all, for persons of the lowest rank. Early in
the day, multitudes of spectators began to arrive,
mostly arrayed in gala dress, and many wearing
the colours of their favourite gladiatorial
champion. With a loud flourish of trumpets the great
gates of the imperial entrance opened, and the
chariots of the Emperors and their respective
<i>suites</i> entered and took their places in the grand
tribune reserved for these august occupants. It
was noted with dissatisfaction by the multitude
that neither of the Empresses Prisca or Valeria,
were present. But the withered old crone Fausta,
mother of Galerius, seemed to gloat like a foul
harpy on the anticipated spectacle of blood, and
near by was her sinister shadow, the black-browed
priest of Cybele.</p>

<p>Our old acquaintance, Burdo, the butcher, was
rubicund with joy at the approaching conflict, for
which, he said, he long had hungered. "But
why," he asked, "are not their majesties, the
Empresses, in the state tribune. 'Tis a contempt
of a festival sacred to the gods."</p>

<p>"Our dainty Empress," jeered Samos, the
"Flat-nose," "has small stomach to see her friends the
Christians given to the lions, and I suspect the old
one is tarred with the same stick."</p>

<p>"If I thought that I'd denounce her myself,"
growled Bruto, the gladiator; "Empress or slave,
the crime of being a Christian levels all ranks."</p>

<p>"And lose your head for your pains," chimed
in Piso, the barber. "Don't you know that she
winds the Emperor round her finger like a silken
thread."</p>

<p>"Does she favour the accursed Nazarenes?"
croaked Ephraim the Jew. "May the same fate
overtake her."</p>

<p>"I thought they were friends of yours," said
our old friend Max, who was one of the soldiers
on guard. "They say this Christus whom they
worship was a Jew."</p>

<p>We dare not repeat the wicked imprecation
which burst from the lips of the exasperated
Israelite. But it is notorious that the Jews were
far more malignant persecutors of the Christians
than even the Pagans themselves&mdash;as is apparent
from the Acts of the Apostles and other records
of the early Church.</p>

<p>The time for beginning the games having come,
the priest of Neptune poured a libation to the
god, and heaped incense on his altar, placed near
the Imperial tribune. In this act of worship&mdash;for
these old gods were worshipped with the blood
of men slain as a holiday pageant&mdash;he was
followed by the Emperors and their chief officers.</p>

<p>Then with another peal of trumpets a procession
of gladiators in burnished armour entered
the arena and marched around its vast circuit.
Pausing before the tribune of the Emperors they
chanted with a loud voice: "<i>Cæsares Augusti,
morituri salutarus vos</i>&mdash;Great Cæsars, we who are
about to die salute you."</p>

<p>First there was a sort of sham battle&mdash;<i>prælusio</i>,
as it was called, in which the gladiators fought
with wooden swords. But the multitude were
speedily impatient of that, and demanded the
combat <i>a l'outrance</i>&mdash;to the death.</p>

<p>"We came not here to witness such child's
play as that," said Burdo, the butcher. "I want
to see the blood flow as it does in my own
shambles;" a brutal sentiment which met with
much favour from his neighbours.</p>

<p>Soon their desires were gratified. First there
was a combat of <i>Andabatæ</i>, that is, men who wore
helmets without any aperture for the eyes, so that
they were obliged to fight blindfold, and thus
excited the mirth of the spectators. Although
they inflicted some ugly wounds upon each other,
none of these were mortal, and the mob called
loudly for the <i>Hoplomachi</i>, who were next on the
play-bill. These were men who fought in a
complete suit of armour. They were as completely
encased as crabs in their shells, but as they could
see each other through the bars of their visors,
they were able skilfully to direct their weapons
at the joints of their antagonist's armour. Soon
the arena was red with blood, and more than one
victim lay dead and trampled on the sands.</p>

<p>"Good! this is something like the thing," cried
Burdo. "But these fellows are so cased in their
shells it is hard to get at them. Let us have the
<i>Retiarii</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, the <i>Retiarii</i> and <i>Mirmillones</i>," shouted
the mob; and they soon marched upon the scene.</p>

<p>This conflict promised abundance of excitement
The <i>Retiarii</i> wore no armour, and their only
weapons were a net (<i>rete</i>, hence their name) and
a trident or three-pronged spear. The <i>Retiarius</i>
endeavoured to throw the net over his antagonist,
and then to despatch him with the spear. If he
missed his aim in throwing his net, he betook
himself to flight, and endeavoured to prepare his
net for a second cast, while his adversary followed
him round the arena in order to kill him before
he could make a second attempt. It was a cruel
sport, and kindled to fury the fierce passions of
the eager spectators.</p>

<p>Then came a conflict between skilled gladiators&mdash;the
most accomplished swordsmen of the
gladiatorial school. The vast multitude watched
with fevered interest the wary fencing, the skilful
guard and rapid thrust and stroke of those trained
butchers of their fellow-men. When a swordsman
was wounded, the spectators rent the air
with cries of "<i>Habet! Habet!</i>" and the one who
was vanquished lowered his arms in token of
submission. His fate, however, depended upon
the will of the people, who sometimes, when a
vanquished swordsman had exhibited especial
dexterity and skill, gave the signal to spare him
by stretching out their hands with the thumbs
turned down. But if, as was more frequently the
case, their bloodthirsty passions were roused to
insatiable fury, they demanded his death by
turning their thumbs upwards, and shouting, "<i>Recipe
ferrum</i>!" Without a tremor the victim then
bared his breast to the sword, and the victor
thrust it home to the hilt, while the cruel mob
shouted their huzzas over the bloody tragedy.</p>

<p>Such is the scene brought vividly before our
minds by the matchless antique statue of the
Dying Gladiator, found in the Gardens of Sallust,
now in the museum of the Capitol. As one gazes
with a strange fascination on that wondrous
marble, instinct, it seems, with mortal agony,
callous must be the heart that is unmoved by
its touching pathos. The exquisite lines of Byron
nobly express the emotions which it awakens in
every breast:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>An unwonted interest was given to this cruel
scene in the Roman amphitheatre, by a novel and
unheard of incident which occurred. The
brilliant young Roman officer, Ligurius Rufus, we
have said, was announced to take part in these
games. It was no uncommon thing for military
fops, eager to win the applause of the multitude,
or to goad their jaded weariness of life into a
momentary excitement by a spice of real danger,
to enter the lists of the arena; and Ligurius was
at once the most brilliant swordsman in the
Twelfth Legion, and the most <i>ennuyée</i> and world-weary
man in Rome.</p>

<p>He was pitted against a brawny Hercules, the
strongest and hugest of the whole school of
gladiators&mdash;a British prisoner of war, who had
been long the pride and boast of the arena. As
they stood face to face, the young officer in
burnished armour, inlaid with silver and gold,
and the mighty thews of his opponent encased in
leather and bronze, the betting was heavy in
favour of the British giant. Each felt that he
had a foeman worthy of his steel. They walked
warily around each other, each watching with
eager eye every movement of his antagonist.
Every thrust on either side was skilfully parried,
any advantage of strength on the part of the
British warrior being matched by the superior
nimbleness of the Roman officer. At last a rapid
thrust by Ligurius severed a tendon in the
sword-arm of his foe, and it fell nerveless by his side.
With a giant effort the disabled warrior sprang
upon the Roman as if to crush him by sheer
weight; but Ligurius nimbly sprang aside, and
his antagonist, slipping in the gory sand, fell
headlong to the ground. In an instant the
Roman's foot was on his neck and his sword at
his breast. With a courteous gesture, Ligurius
raised his sword and waved it toward the
Emperors' tribune and to the crowded seats of the
podium, as if asking the signal to spare the
vanquished gladiator, while the despairing look
of the latter seemed with mute eloquence to ask
for life. "<i>Habet! Habet!</i>" rang round the
Coliseum, but not a single sign of mercy was made,
not a single thumb was reversed. "<i>Recipe ferrum</i>,"
roared the mob at the prostrate giant; and
then shouted to Ligurius, "<i>Occide! Occide!</i>&mdash;Kill!
Kill!"</p>

<p>The gallant Roman heeded them as he would
heed the howl of wolves. "I am not a butcher,"
he said, with a defiant sneer, and he sheathed his
sword and, much to the surprise of his
discomfitted foe, lent his hand to raise him from the
ground.</p>

<p>"You are a brave man," he said, "I want you
as a standard bearer for the Twelfth Legion.
That is better than making worm's meat of you.
Rome may need such soldiers before long."</p>

<p>The Emperors were not unwilling to grant this
novel request of a favourite officer, and the grateful
creature, in token of his fidelity, humbly kissed
the hand of Ligurius, and followed him from the
arena. The cruel mob, however, angered at being
deprived of their anticipated spectacle of blood,
howled with rage, and demanded the crowning
scene of the day's sports&mdash;the conflict between
the wild beasts and the Christian martyrs.</p>

<p>These hateful scenes had become the
impassioned delight of all classes, from the Emperors
to the "vile plebs" of Rome. Even woman's
pitiful nature forgot its tenderness, and maids
and matrons gloated on the cruel spectacle, and
the honour was reserved for the Vestal Virgin
to give the signal for the mortal stroke. Such
scenes created a ferocious thirst for blood throughout
society. They overthrew the altar of pity,
and impelled to every excess and refinement of
barbarity. Even children imitated the cruel
sport in their games, schools of gladiators were
trained for the work of slaughter, women fought
in the arena or lay dead and trampled in the
sand.</p>

<p>It is to the eternal praise of Christianity that
it suppressed these odious contests, and forever
averted the sword of the gladiator from the throat
of his victim. The Christian city of Constantinople
was never polluted by the atrocious exhibition.
A Christian poet eloquently denounced
the bloody spectacle. A Christian monk, roused
to indignation by the hateful scene, leaped over
the barrier to separate the gladiators in the very
frenzy of the conflict. The maddened mob,
enraged at this interruption of their sport, stoned
him to death. But his heroic martydom
produced a moral revulsion against the practice,
and the laws of Honorius, to use the language of
Gibbon, "abolished forever the human sacrifices
of the amphitheatre."</p>

<p>It remains to notice in another chapter the last
scene in the stern drama of this "Roman
holiday."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE MARTYRS CROWNED.</p>

<p class="dropcap">At a flourish of trumpets the iron-studded
doors of the cells in which the Christians
were confined were thrown open, and the destined
martyrs walked forth on the arena in the sight
of assembled thousands. It was a spectacle to
arrest the attention of even the most thoughtless,
and to move the sympathy of even the most
austere. At the head of the little company walked
the good presbyter, Demetrius, his silvery hair
and beard and benignant expression of countenance
giving him a strikingly venerable aspect. Leaning
heavily on his arm, evidently faint in frame but
strong in spirit, was his daughter Callirhoë.
Robed in white, she looked the embodiment of
saintly purity, and in her eyes there beamed a
heroic courage which inspired a wonder that so
brave a soul should be shrined in so frail a body.
Adauctus, Aurelius, and other Christian
confessors condemned to death, made up the little
contingent of the noble army of martyrs.</p>

<p>The prefect Naso, from his place in the
tribune, near the Emperors, read the sentence of
the court, that the accused having been proven by
ample testimony to be the enemies of the Cæsars
and of the gods, had been condemned to death
by exposure to wild beasts.</p>

<p>"Nay, not the enemies of the Cæsars,"
exclaimed the aged Demetrius. "We are the friends
of all, the enemies of none.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> We pray for the
Cæsars at all our assemblies."</p>

<p>"Will you do homage to the gods?" demanded
Diocletian. "Will you burn incense to Neptune?
Here is his altar and here are his priests."</p>

<p>"We worship the true God who made the
heavens and the earth, the sea and all that in
them is," replied the venerable man, with uplifted
and reverent countenance, "and Him only will
we serve. They be no gods which are made
by man's device, and 'tis idolatry to serve them."</p>

<p>"Away with the Atheists," cried the priests
of Neptune; "they blaspheme the holy gods."</p>

<p>"The Christians to the lions!" roared the mob,
and at the signal from the Emperor to the master
of the games, the dens of the wild beasts were
thrown open, and the savage brutes, starved into
madness, bounded into the arena. The defenceless
martyrs fell upon their knees in prayer, and
seemed conscious only of the presence of Him
who stood with the three Hebrews in the fiery
furnace, so rapt was the expression of faith and
courage on their upturned faces.</p>

<p>The fierce Numidian lions, and tigers from the
Libyan desert, instead of bounding upon their
prey, began to circle slowly around them, lashing
their tawny flanks meanwhile, glaring at their
victims from bloodshot fiery eyes, and uttering
horrid growls.</p>

<p>At this moment a loud shout was heard, and a
soldier, clad in burnished mail, and with his
drawn sword in his hand, one of the body guards
of the Emperors, leaped from the tribune and
bounded with clashing armour into the arena.
Striding across the sand, he hurled aside his iron
helmet and his sword, and flung himself at the
feet of the aged priest, with the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father, your blessing; Callirhoë, your parting
kiss. I, too, am a Christian. Long time have I
sought you, alas! only to find you thus. But
gladly will I die with you, and, separated in life,
we are united in death and forever."</p>

<p>"<i>Nunc dimittis, Domine!</i>" exclaimed the old
man, raising his eyes to heaven. "'Now, Lord,
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.'" And
he laid his hands in blessing on the head of his
long-lost son.</p>

<p>"Ezra, my brother!" exclaimed Callirhoë,
folding him in her arms. "To think we were so
near, yet knew not of each other. Thank God,
we go to heaven together; and, long divided on
earth, we shall soon, with our beloved mother, be
a united family forever in the skies. 'And God
shall wipe away all tears from our eyes; and
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
crying, neither shall there be any more pain.'"</p>

<p>"Amen! even so, come, Lord Jesus!" spake
the young soldier, as he enfolded, as if in a
sheltering embrace, the gray-haired sire and the
fair-faced girl.</p>

<p>The utmost consternation was exhibited on the
countenance of the old Emperor Diocletian.
"What! have we Christians and traitors even in
our body guard? Our very life is at the mercy
of those wretches!"</p>

<p>"I would feel safer with them," said the more
stoical or more courageous Galerius, "than with
the <i>delators</i> and informers who betray them," and
he glanced with mingled contempt and aversion
at Naso, the prefect, and Furca, the priest.
"When a Christian gives his word, 'tis sacred
as all the oaths of Hecate. I want no better soldiers
than those of the Thundering Legion."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the wild beasts, startled for a
moment by the sudden apparition of the mail-clad
soldier, seemed roused thereby to ten-fold fury.
Crouching stealthily for the fatal spring, they
bounded upon their prey, and in a moment
crashing bones and streaming gore appeased the growing
impatience of the cruel mob, who seemed, like
the very wild beasts, to hunger and thirst for
human flesh and blood.</p>

<p>We dwell not on the painful spectacle. The
gallant young soldier was the first to die. The
brave girl, with a gesture of maiden modesty,
drew her dishevelled robe about her person, and
with a queenly dignity awaited the wild beast's
fatal spring. She was mercifully spared the
spectacle of her father's dying agony. Her
over-strung nerves gave way, and she fell in a swoon
upon the sands. Demetrius met his fate praying
upon his knees. Like Stephen, he gazed
steadfastly up into heaven, and the fashion of his
countenance was suddenly transfigured as he
exclaimed: "Lord Jesus! Rachel, my beloved!
we come, we come." And above the roar of the
ribald mob and the growl of the savage beasts,
fell sweetly on his inner ear the song of the
redeemed, and burst upon his sight the beatific
vision of the Lord he loved, and for whom he
gladly died.</p>

<p>So, too, like brave men, victorious o'er their
latest foe, Adauctus, Aurelius, and the others
calmly met their fate. When all the rest were
slain, a lordly lion approached the prostrate form
of Callirhoë, but she was already dead. She had
passed from her swoon, without a pang, to the
marriage supper of the Lamb&mdash;to the presence of
the Celestial Bridegroom&mdash;the fairest among ten
thousand, the one altogether lovely&mdash;to whom the
homage of her young heart had been fully given.
She was spared, too, the indignity, of being mangled
by the lion's jaws. When the king of beasts
found that she was already dead, he raised his
massy head, gave a mournful howl, and strode
haughtily away.</p>

<p>In the great gallery of Doré paintings at
London, is one of this Flavian Amphitheatre after
a human sacrifice such as we have described.
There lie the mangled forms upon the gory and
trampled sands. The sated wild beasts prowl
listlessly over the arena. The circling seats rise
tier above tier, empty and desolate. But poised
in air, with outspread wings, above the slain,
with a countenance of light and a palm of victory,
is a majestic angel; and sweeping upward in
serried ranks, amid the shining stars, is a cloud
of bright-winged angels, the convoy of the
martyrs' spirits to the skies. So, doubtless, God
sent a cohort of sworded seraphim to bear the
martyrs of our story blessed company, and to
sweep with them through the gates into the city.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE MARTYRS BURIED.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Darker and darker grew the shadows of night
over the great empty and desolate amphitheatre,
but a few hours before clamorous with the
shouts and din of the tumultuous mob. The silence
seemed preternatural, and a solemn awfulness
seemed to invest the shrouded forms which lay
upon the sand. By a merciful provision of the
Roman law, it made not war upon the dead, and
the bodies even of criminals were given up to
their friends, if they had any, that they might
not be deprived of funeral rites. Having wreaked
his cruel rage upon the living body, the pagan
magistrate at least did not deny the privilege of
burial to the martyrs' mutilated remains. It
was esteemed by the primitive believers as much
an honour as a duty, to ensepulchre with Christian
rites the remains of the sacred dead.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Faustus, the faithful freedman of Adauctus,
Hilarus, the fossor, and the servants of the
Christian matron, Marcella, came at the fall of night
to bear away the bodies of the martyrs to their
final resting-place in the silent Catacomb. The
service was not devoid of danger, for vile
informers prowled around seeking to discover and
betray whomsoever would pay the rites of
sepulture to the remains of the Christian martyrs.
But there are golden keys which will unlock any
doors and seal any lips, and Marcella spared
not her wealth in this sacred service.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, too, special facility
was given for carrying out this pious purpose.
Through the influence of the Empress Valeria,
Hilarus, the fossor, was enabled to show to the
chief custodian of the amphitheatre an
authorization under the hand of Galerius for removing
the bodies of the "criminals who had paid the
penalty of the law"&mdash;so ran the rescript.</p>

<p>Beneath the cliff-like shadow of the Coliseum
gathered this little Christian company. The iron
gates opened their ponderous jaws. By the fitful
flare of a torch weirdly lighting up the vaulted
arches, with gentle and reverent hands, as though
the cold clay could still feel their lightest touch,
the bodies of the dead were laid upon the biers.
Through the silent streets, devout men in silence
bore the martyrs to their burial. Through the
Porta Capena, which opened to the magic spell
of the Emperor's order; through the silent
"Street of Tombs," still lined with the monuments
of Rome's mighty dead, wended slowly the solemn
procession. There was no wailing of the pagan
<i>nænia</i> or funeral dirge, neither was there the
chanting of the Christian hymn. But in silence,
or with only whispered utterance, they reached
the door of the private grounds of the Villa
Marcella.</p>

<p>First the bodies were borne to the villa, where,
by loving hands, the stains of dust and blood
were washed away. Then, robed in white and
bestrewn with flowers, they were placed on the
biers in the marble atriun. Again the good
presbyter Primitius read the words of life as at
the burial of Lucius, the martyr,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and vows and
prayers were offered up to God.</p>

<p>While this solemn service was in progress, a
lady, deeply-veiled, was seen to be agitated by
violent grief. Convulsive sobs shook her frame,
and her tears fell fast. When the forms of the
martyrs were uncovered, that their friends might
take their last farewell, the Empress Valeria, for
it was she, flung herself on her knees beside the
body of the late slave maiden, and rained tears
of deep emotion on her face. More lovely in
death than in life, the fine-cut features seemed
like the most exquisite work of the sculptor
carved in translucent alabaster. A crown of
asphodel blossoms the emblems of immortality&mdash;encircled
her brow, and a palm branch&mdash;the
symbol of the martyr's victory&mdash;was placed upon
her breast.</p>

<p>"Give her an honoured place among the holy
dead," said the Empress, amid her sobs, to the
venerable Primitius.</p>

<p>"I have given orders," said the Lady Marcella,
"that she, with her father and brother, shall sleep
side by side in the chamber prepared as the last
resting-place for my own family. We shall count
it a precious privilege, in God's own good time,
to be laid to rest near the dust of His holy
confessors and martyrs."</p>

<p>"Aurelius shall share the tomb," said Hilarus,
the fossor, "which he made for himself while yet
alive, beside his noble wife, Aurelia Theudosia."</p>

<p>"Be it mine to honour with a memorial tablet
the remains of my good master Adauctus," said
Faustus, the freedman, with deep emotion.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>"It shall be my privilege," said the Empress,
"to provide for my beloved handmaiden, as a
mark of the great love I bore her, a memorial of
her saintly virtues; and let her bear my name in
death as in life, so that those who read her epitaph
may know she was the freedwoman and friend of
an unhappy Empress."</p>

<p>The Empress Valeria now retired, and with her
trusty escort, returned to the city.</p>

<p>With psalms and hymns, and the solemn
chanting of such versicles as: <i>"Convertere anima
mea, in requiem tuam"</i>&mdash;"Return unto thy rest,
O my soul;" and <i>"Si ambulavero in medio umbræ
mortis, non timebo mala"</i>&mdash;"Though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall
fear no evil," the funeral procession wound its way,
by gleaming torchlight, through the cypress
glades of the garden to the entrance of the
Catacomb of Callixtus. Here additional torches and
tapers were lighted, and carefully the sacred
burdens were carried down the long and narrow
stair, and through the intricate passages to the
family vault of the Lady Marcella.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Subterranean Oratory, Catacomb Of Callixtus.</span>
</div>

<p>This vault was one of unusual size and loftiness,
and had been especially prepared for holding
religious service during the outbreak of
persecution. Marcella held the office of deaconess in
the Christian Church, and when even the privacy
of her own house was not a sufficient safeguard
against the prying of pagan spies, she was wont
to retire to the deeper seclusion of this
subterranean place of prayer. On each side of the door
were seats hewn in the solid rock, one for the
deaconess, the other for the female catechist who
shared her pious labours. Around the wall was
a low stone seat for the female catechumens, for
the most part members of her own household,
who here received religious instruction. The
accompanying engraving indicates the appearance
of this ancient oratory or class-room, its main
features unchanged, although the lapse of centuries
has somewhat marred its structure and defaced its
beauty.</p>

<p>With solemn rites and prayers the remains
of the martyrs were consigned to their last long
resting-place. Amid the sobs and tears of the
mourners, the good presbyter Primitius paid a
loving tribute to their holy lives and heroic death&mdash;all
the more thrilling because they themselves
stood in jeopardy every hour. In the presence
of the martyred dead the venerable pastor then
broke the bread and poured the wine of the Last
Supper of the Lord, and the little company of
worshippers seemed united in still closer
fellowship with those who now kept the sacred feast
in the kingdom of their common Father and God.</p>

<p>Before they left the chamber, Hilarus, after he
had hermetically sealed the tombs of Demetrius
and Ezra, his son, cemented with plaster a marble
slab against the opening of that on which was
laid&mdash;rude couch for form so fair&mdash;the body of
the chief subject of our "ower true tale." As it
was designed to be but a temporary memorial of
the virgin martyr, until the costly epitaph which
the Empress was to provide should be ready, he
took the little pot of pigment which he had
brought for the purpose, and with his brush in,
scribed the brief sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">VALERIA DORMIT IN PACE.<br />
ANIMA DULCIS, INNOCVA, SAPIENS ET PVLCHP IN XRO.<br />
QVI VIXIT ANNOS XVIII. EN. V. DIES X.<br /><br />

"Valeria sleeps in peace. A sweet spirit<br />
guileless, wise, beautiful in Christ. She lived<br />
eighteen years, five months, ten days."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/valeriamartyrofc00withiala_0007.png" width="400" height="194" alt="&quot;VALERIA SLEEPS IN PEACE.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;VALERIA SLEEPS IN PEACE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Alas! the time never came when that costly
memorial should be reared. The violence of
persecution soon drove the Empress herself an
exile from her home, and when the storm rolled
away there was none left to carry out her pious
wish. Through the long centuries that humble
epitaph was all the memorial of one of the noblest,
sweetest, bravest souls that ever lived. And even
that rude slab was not destined always to cover
her remains. After the re-discovery of the
Catacombs in the sixteenth century, many of their
tombs were pillaged for relics, or in the vain
search for treasure. By some ruthless rifler of
the grave this very slab was shivered, and the
lower part of the epitaph destroyed; and there
upon its rocky bed, on which it had reposed for
well-nigh fifteen hundred years, lay in mouldering
dust the remains of the maiden martyr, Valeria
Callirhoë. Verily <i>Pulvis et umbra sumus</i>!</p>

<p>Primitius and Hilarus, with the little company
of devout men who bore the martyrs to their
burial, now proceeded to the entombment, in a
neighbouring crypt, of the bodies of Adauctus
and Aurelius. As they advanced through the
dark corridors, but dimly lighted by their tapers'
feeble rays, the silence of that under-world
seemed almost appalling. Black shadows crouched
around, and their footsteps echoed strangely down
the distant passages, dying gradually away in this
vast valley of the shadow of death. Almost in
silence their sacred task was completed, and they
softly sang a funeral hymn before they turned to
leave their martyred brethren to their last long
sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was heard the tumultuous
"tramp, tramp," as of armed men. Then the clang
of iron mail and bronze cuirass resounded through
the vaulted corridors. The glare of torches was
seen at the end of a long arched passage, and
the sharp, swift word of military command rang
out stern and clear.</p>

<p>"Forward! Seize the caitiffs! Let not one
escape! Slay if they resist!" and a rush was
made to the chamber where the notes of the
Christian psalm had but now died away.</p>

<p>"Out with your lights!" exclaimed, in a muffled
tone, Hilarus, the fossor. "Follow me as closely
and as quietly as you can. Good Father
Primitius, your arm. By God's help we will
disappoint those hunters of men of their anticipated
prey."</p>

<p>"Or join our brethren in martyrdom, as is His
will," devoutly added Primitius. "He doeth all
things well."</p>

<p>But we must go back a little to learn the cause
and means of this armed invasion of the Catacombs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE BETRAYAL&mdash;THE PURSUIT.</p>

<p class="dropcap">When the unhappy Isidorus discovered that
through his cowardice and tergiversation,
and through the confessions extorted from his
distempered mind, a criminal charge had been
trumped up against the fair Callirhoë, whose
beauty and grace had touched his susceptible
imagination, he was almost beside himself with
rage and remorse. He protested to the Prefect
Naso and his disreputable son, Calphurnius, that
she was as innocent as an unweaned babe of the
monstrous crime alleged against her&mdash;that of
conspiracy to poison her beloved mistress.</p>

<p>"Accursed be the day," cried the wretched
Isidorus, clenching his hands till his nails pierced
the flesh, "accursed be the day when I first came
to your horrid den to betray innocent blood.
Would I had perished e'er it dawned."</p>

<p>"Hark you, my friend," said Naso, "do you
remember by what means you promised to earn
the good red gold with which I bought you?"</p>

<p>"Do not remind me of my shame in becoming
a spy upon the Christians," cried the Greek with
a look of self-loathing and abhorrence.</p>

<p>"Nay; 'by becoming one yourself,' that was
the phrase as I wrote it on my tablets," sneered
the prefect.</p>

<p>"Would that I could become one!" exclaimed
the unhappy man.</p>

<p>"Suppose I take you at your word and believe
you are one?" queried Naso with a malignant
leer.</p>

<p>"What new wickedness is this you have in
your mind?" asked the Greek.</p>

<p>"How would you like to share the doom of
your friends, the old Jew and his pretty daughter,
who are to be thrown to the lions to-day," went
on the remorseless man, toying with his victim
like a tiger with its prey.</p>

<p>"Gladly, were I but worthy," said the Greek.
"Had I their holy hopes, I would rejoice to bear
them company."</p>

<p>"But don't you see," said Naso, "a word of
mine would send you to the arena, whether you
like it or not? Your neck is in the noose, my
handsome youth, and I do not think, with all your
dexterity, you can wriggle out of it."</p>

<p>"Oh! any fate but that!" cried the Greek,
writhing in anguish. "Let me die as a felon, a
conspirator, an assassin, if you will; but not by
the doom of the martyrs."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," went on the prefect, "justice
is meted out to the Christians so much more
swiftly and certainly than even against the worst
of felons, that I am tempted to take this plan to
secure you your deserts."</p>

<p>The craven-spirited Greek, to whom the very
idea of death was torture, blanched with terror
and stood speechless, his tongue literally cleaving
to the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>When the prefect perceived that he was
sufficiently unnerved for his final experiment he
unveiled his diabolical purpose.</p>

<p>"Hark you, my friend," he whispered or rather
hissed into his ear, "you may do the State,
yourself, and me a service, that will procure you life
and liberty and fortune. You know the way to the
secret assemblies of the accursed Christian sect;
lead hither a maniple of soldiers and your
fortune's made."</p>

<p>"Tempter, begone!" exclaimed the Greek in
a moment of virtuous indignation, "you would
make me worse than Judas whom the Christians
execrate as the betrayer of his Master whom they
worship."</p>

<p>"As you please, my dainty youth," answered
Naso, with his characteristic gesture of clutching
his sword. "Prepare to feed the lions on the
morrow," and he consigned him to a cell in the
vaults of the Coliseum.</p>

<p>Very different was the night spent by this
craven soul to that of the destined martyrs. The
darkness, to his distempered imagination, seemed
full of accusing eyes, which glared reproach and
vengeance upon him. The hungry lions' roar
smote his soul with fearful apprehensions. When
the savage bounds of the wild beasts shook his
cell he cowered upon the ground, the picture of
abject misery and despair.</p>

<p>When by these mental tortures his nerves were
all unstrung, the arch tempter silently entered
his cell and whispered in his ear, "Well, my
dainty Greek, are you ready for the games?"</p>

<p>"Save me! save me!" cried the unhappy man,
"any death but that! I will do anything to
escape such a fearful doom."</p>

<p>"I thought you would come to terms," replied
the prefect, well skilled in the cruel arts of his
office. "Life is sweet. Here is gold. By the
service I require you shall earn liberty," and the
compact was sealed whereby the Greek was to
betray the subterranean hiding-places of the
Christians to their enemies.</p>

<p>Hence it was that at the dead of night, a band
of Roman soldiers, reckless ruffians trained to
slaughter in many a bloody war, marched under
cover of darkness along the Appian Way to the
villa of the Lady Marcella. It was the work of
a moment to force the door of the vineyard and
they soon reached the entrance to the Catacomb.</p>

<p>"It is like a badger's burrow," said the officer
in command. "We will soon bag our game,
Here the old priest has his lair. Secure him at
any cost. He is worth a score of the meaner
vermin."</p>

<p>Lighting their torches they inarched on their
devious way under the guidance of Isidorus, who
had written on a rude chart the number of turns
to be made to the right or left. With Roman
military foresight, the officer marked with chalk
the route they took, and fixed occasionally a torch
in the niches in the wall.</p>

<p>Soon the soft, low cadence of the funeral hymn
was heard, stealing weirdly on the ear, and a faint
light glimmered from the chamber in which the
Christians were paying the last rites to their
martyred brethren.</p>

<p>"They are at their incantations now," said the
Centurion. "'Tis a fit place for their abominable
orgies. Let us hasten, and we will spoil their
wicked spells!" and he gave the command, at
which the soldiers rushed forward toward the
distant light.</p>

<p>Instantly it disappeared, and when they reached
the spot naught was seen, save the tomb of
Adauctus; and in the distant darkness was heard
the sound of hurrying feet.</p>

<p>"The rats have fled," cried the officer; "after
them, ferrets! Let not one escape!" and at the
head of the maniple he darted down the echoing
corridor.</p>

<p>But Hilarus guided his friends amid the
darkness more swiftly than the soldiers could pursue
by the light of their torches. He followed many
a devious winding, especially contrived to frustrate
capture, and facilitate escape. Threading a very
narrow passage, he drew from a niche a wooden
ladder, and placing it against the wall reached a
stairway which began high up near the roof. The
whole party followed, and Hilarus, drawing up
the ladder after him, completely cut off pursuit.
They soon reached the comparatively lofty vaults
of a deserted <i>arenarium</i>, or sand pit, which communicated
with the open air. As he stood with
bared brow beneath the light of the silent stars,
the good Presbyter Primitius devoutly exclaimed:&mdash;"<i>Anima
nostra sicut passer erepta est de lagueo
venantium</i>&mdash;Our soul is escaped as a bird out the
snare of the fowler, the snare is broken and we
are escaped."</p>

<p>The writer has not drawn upon his imagination
in describing the arrangements for escape made
by the persecuted Christians, when taking refuge
in these dens and caves of the earth. In this
very Catacomb of Callixtus, such a secret stairway
still exists, and is illustrated by drawings in his
book on this subject. The main entrance was
completely obstructed and the stairway partially
destroyed, so as to prevent ingress to the
Catacomb, and a narrow stairway was constructed in
the roof which could only be reached by a
moveable ladder, connecting it with the floor. By
drawing up this ladder pursuit could be easily
cut off, and escape to a neighbouring <i>arenarium</i>
secured. Stores of corn, and oil, and wine have
been found in these crypts, evidently as a
provision in time of persecution; frequent wells also
occur, amply sufficient for the supply of water;
and the multitude of lamps which have been
found would dispel the darkness, while their
sudden extinction would prove the best concealment
from attack by their enemies. Hence the
Christians were stigmatized as a skulking,
darkness-loving race,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> who fled the light of day
to burrow like moles in the earth. These
labyrinths were admirably adapted for eluding
pursuit. Familiar with their intricacies, and
following a well-known clew, the Christian could
plunge fearlessly into the darkness, where his
pursuer would soon be inextricably lost.</p>

<p>Such hairbreadth escapes as we have described
from the Roman soldiers, like sleuth hounds
tracking their prey, must have been no uncommon
events in those troublous times. But sometimes
the Christians were surprised at their devotions,
and their refuge became their sepulchre. Such
was the tragic fate of Stephen, slain even while
ministering at the altar; such the event described
by Gregory of Tours, when a hecatomb of victims
were immolated at once by heathen hate; such
the peril which wrung from a stricken heart the
cry, not of anger but of grief, recorded on a slab
in the Catacombs: <i>Tempora infausta, quibus
inter sacra et vota ne in cavernis quidem salvari
possimus!</i>&mdash;"Oh! sad times in which, among
sacred rites and prayers, even in caverns, we are
not safe." It requires no great effort of
imagination to conceive of the dangers and escapes which
must have been frequent episodes in the heroic
lives of the early soldiers of the cross.</p>

<p>With what emotions must the primitive
believers, seeking refuge in these crypts, have held
their solemn worship and heard the words of life,
surrounded by the dead in Christ! With what
power would come the promise of the resurrection
of the body, amid the crumbling relics of mortality!
How fervent their prayers for their
companions in tribulation, when they themselves
stood in jeopardy every hour! Their holy ambition
was to witness a good confession even unto death.
They burned to emulate the zeal of the martyrs
of the faith, the plumeless heroes of a nobler
chivalry than that of arms, the Christian athletes
who won in the bloody conflicts of the arena, or
amid the fiery tortures of the stake, not a crown
of laurel or of bay, but a crown of life, starry and
unwithering, that can never pass away. Their
humble graves are grander monuments than the
trophied tombs of Rome's proud conquerors upon
the Appian Way. Reverently may we mention
their names. Lightly may we tread beside their ashes.</p>

<p>Though the bodily presence of those conscripts
of the tomb no longer walked among men, their
intrepid spirit animated the heart of each member
of that little community of persecuted Christians,
"of whom the world was not worthy; who wandered
in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens
and caves of the earth, ... being destitute,
afflicted, tormented."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p class="center">THE DOOM OF THE TRAITOR</p>

<p class="dropcap">But what, meantime, had become of the
pursuers? Baffled in their effort to seize
their prey, and fearful of losing their way in this
tangled labyrinth they had sullenly retreated,
tracing their steps by the chalk-marks they had
made upon the walls. At last, they returned to
the stairway by which they had entered and so
found their way above ground.</p>

<p>"This is no work for soldiers," muttered the
disgusted officer, "hunting these rats through
their underground runs. They are a skulking
set of vermin."</p>

<p>"What has become of that coward Greek?"
asked the second in command. "He didn't seem
to half like the job."</p>

<p>"Is he not here? Then he must have made
his escape," said the Centurion. "But if he is
caught in that rat-trap, there let him stay. I'll
not risk a Roman soldier's life to save a craven
Greek," and he gave the command to march back
to the city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, how fares it with the unhappy
Isidorus?</p>

<p>When the soldiers caught sight of the Christians
and began their pursuit, he had no heart to join
in it, and lingered in the vaulted chamber where
the funeral rites had been interrupted. The first
thing that caught his eye was the epitaph of the
noble Adauctus. With quavering voice he read
the lines we have already given: "With unfaltering
faith, despising the lord of the world, having
confessed Christ, thou dids't seek the celestial
realms."</p>

<p>"And this was he," he soliloquised, "who gave
up name, and fame, and fortune, high office, and
the favour of the Emperor, and embraced shame,
and persecution, and a cruel death for conscience
sake. How grand he was that day when I warned
him of the machinations of his foes&mdash;so undaunted
and calm. But grander he is as he lies in the
majesty of death behind that slab. I felt myself
a coward in his living presence then, but in the
presence of this dead map, I feel a greater coward
still. His memory haunts, it tortures me, I must
away!" and turning from, the chamber, he
wandered by the dim light of his taper down the
grave-lined corridor, pausing at times to read
their humble inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rudely written, but each letter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of hope, and yet of heart-break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of all the tender pathos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the here and the hereafter.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And their calmness and peacefulness seemed to
reproach his conscience-smitten and unrestful
soul.</p>

<p>Listlessly he turned into another chamber,
when, what was it that met his startled vision!&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">VALERIA DORMIT IN PACE.</span></p>

<p>There slept in the sleep of death another victim
of his perfidy, one whom he had longed to save,
one whose beauty had fascinated his imagination,
whose goodness had touched his heart. Overcome
by his emotion he flung himself on the ground,
and bursting into convulsive sobs that shook his
frame, he passionately kissed the cold stone slab
on which was written the much-loved name.</p>

<p>"Would that I, too, slept the sleep of death,"
he exclaimed; "if I might also sleep in peace; if
I might seek celestial realms.... So near and yet
so far ... A great gulf fixed ... Never to see thee
more ... in time nor in eternity."</p>

<p>Here the drip, drip of water which had
infiltrated through the roof and fell upon the floor,
jarred upon his excited nerves, and suddenly, with
a hissing splash, fell a great drop on his taper and
utterly extinguished its light. For a moment,
so intense and sudden was the darkness, he was
almost dazed; but instantly the greatness of his
peril flashed upon his mind.</p>

<p>"Lost! Lost!" he frantically shrieked. "The
outer darkness, the eternal wailing while she is
in the light of life! Well I remember now the
words of Primitius, in this very vault, as he spoke
of the joys of heaven, the pains of hell;" and in
the darkness he tried to trace with his finger the
words, "<span class="smcap">DORMIT IN PACE</span>"&mdash;"Sleeps in peace."</p>

<p><i>"Vale! Vale! Eternum Vale!"</i> he sobbed, as
he kissed once more the marble slab, "an
everlasting farewell! I must try to find the
Christians, or the soldiers, or a way of escape from this
prison-house of graves."</p>

<p>He groped his way to the door of the vault and
listened, oh! so eagerly&mdash;all the faculties of his
body and mind seeming concentered in his sense
of hearing. But "the darkness gave no token and
the silence was unbroken." Nay, so awful was
the stillness that brooded over this valley of death,
that it seemed as if the motion of the earth on
its axis must be audible, and the pulses of his
temples were to his tortured ear like the roaring
of the distant sea.</p>

<p>Venturing forth, he groped his way from grave
to grave, from vault to vault, from corridor to
corridor, but no light, no sound, no hope! Ever
denser seemed the darkness, ever deeper the
silence, ever more appalling the gloom. For hours
he wandered on and on till, faint with hunger,
parched with thirst, the throbbings, of his heart
shaking his unnerved frame, he fell into a merciful
swoon from which he never awoke. Centuries
after, an explorer of this vast necropolis found
crouching in the corner of one of its chambers a
fleshless skeleton, and on the tomb above he read
the words, <span class="smcap">VALERIA DORMIT IN PACE</span>. Was it
accident or Providence, or some strange instinct
of locality that had brought this poor blighted
wreck to breathe his latest sigh at the tomb of
one whom he had so loved and so wronged?</p>

<p>The peasants of the Campagna tell to the
present day of certain strange sounds heard at
midnight from those hollow vaults&mdash;at times like
the hooting of an owl, at times like the wailing
of the wind, and at times, they whisper with
bated breath, like the moaning of a soul in pain.
And the guides to the Catacombs aver, that ever
on the anniversary of the martyrdom of Valeria
Callirhoë, sighs and groans echo through the
hollow vaults&mdash;the sighs and groans, tradition
whispers, of a wretched apostate who in the ages
of persecution betrayed the early Christians to a
martyr's doom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">FATE OF THE PERSECUTORS&mdash;TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It remains only to trace briefly the fate of
the unfortunate Empress Valeria&mdash;less
happy than her lowly namesake, the martyr of
the Catacombs&mdash;and the doom of the persecuting
tyrants. In the violent and bloody deaths, often
more terrible than those which they inflicted on
the Christians, which overtook, with scarce an
exception, these enemies of the Church of God,
the early believers recognized a divine retribution
no less inexorable than the avenging Nemesis of
the Pagan mythology.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Diocletian, smitten by a mental malady,
abandoned the throne of the world for the solitude of
his palace on the Illyrian shores of the Adriatic,
where tradition avers that he died by his own
hand.</p>

<p>A still more dreadful doom befell the fierce
persecutor, Galerius. Consumed by the same
loathsome and incurable disease which is recorded
to have smitten his great rivals in bloodshed,
Herod the Great and Philip II., from his dying
couch he implored the prayers of the Christians,
and, stung by remorse for his cruelties,
commanded the surcease of their long and bitter
persecution.</p>

<p>The Empress Valeria, his widow, by her beauty
had the ill fortune to attract the regards of his
successor in persecution, the Emperor Maximin.
Spurning his suit with the scorn becoming a pure
and high-souled woman, at once the daughter and
widow of an Emperor, she encountered his deadly
hate. Her estates were confiscated, her trusted
servants tortured, and her dearest friends put to
death.</p>

<p>"The Empress herself," says Gibbon, "together
with her mother, Prisca, was condemned to exile;
and as they were ignominiously hurried from
place to place, before they were confined to a
sequestered village in the deserts of Syria, they
exposed their shame and distress to the provinces
of the East, which during thirty years, had
respected their august dignity." On the death of
Maximin, Valeria escaped from exile and repaired
in disguise to the court of his successor, Licinius,
hoping for more humane treatment. But these
hopes, to use again the language of Gibbon, "were
soon succeeded by horror and astonishment, and
the bloody execution which stained the palace
of Nicomedia sufficiently convinced her that the
throne of Maximin was filled by a tyrant more
inhuman than himself. Valeria consulted her
safety by hasty flight, and, still accompanied by
her mother Prisca, they wandered above fifteen
months through the provinces in the disguise of
plebeian habits. They were at length discovered
at Thessalonica; and as the sentence of their
death was already pronounced, they were
immediately beheaded and their bodies thrown into
the sea. The people gazed on the melancholy
spectacle; but their grief and indignation were
suppressed by the terrors of a military guard.
Such was the unworthy fate of the wife and
daughter of Diocletian. We lament their
misfortunes, we cannot discover their crimes."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>At length, on the triumph of the British-born
Emperor, Constantine, over his rivals for the
throne of the world, like the trump of Jubilee,
the edict of the toleration of Christianity, pealed
through the land. It penetrated the gloomy
dungeon, the darksome mine, the Catacombs' dim
labyrinth, and from their sombre depths, vast
processions of "noble wrestlers for religion,"
thronged to the long-forsaken churches, with
grateful songs of praise to God.</p>

<p>Christianity, after long repression, became at
length triumphant. It emerged from the
concealment of the Catacombs to the sunshine of imperial
favour. Constantine, himself, proclaimed to eager
thousands the New Evangel&mdash;the most august lay
preacher the Church has ever known. The legend
of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus strikingly
illustrates the wondrous transformation of society.
These Christian brothers, taking shelter in a cave
during the Decian persecution, awoke, according
to the legend, after a slumber of over a century,
to find Christianity everywhere dominant, and a
Christian Emperor on the throne of the Cæsars.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
The doctrines of Christ, like the rays of the sun,
quickly irradiated the world. With choirs and
hymns, in cities and villages, in the highways and
markets, the praises of the Almighty were sung.
The enemies of God were as though they had not
been.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The Lord brought up the vine of
Christianity from a far country, and cast out the
heathen, and planted and watered it, till it twined
round the sceptre of the Cæsars, wreathed the
columns of the Capitol, and filled the whole land.
The heathen fanes were deserted, the gods
discrowned, and the pagan flamen no longer offered
sacrifice to the Capitoline Jove, Rome, which had
dragged so many conquered deities in triumph at
its chariot wheels, at length yielded to a mightier
than all the gods of Olympus. The old faiths
faded from the firmament of human thought as the
stars of midnight at the dawn of day. The
banished deities forsook their ancient seats. They
walked no longer in the vale of Tempe nor in
the grove of Daphne. The naiads bathed not in
Scamander's stream nor Simois, nor the nereids
in the waters of the bright Ægean Sea. The
nymphs and dryads ceased to haunt the sylvan
solitudes. The oriads walked no more in light
on Ida's lofty top.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O ye vain false gods of Hellas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye are vanished evermore!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Long before the recognition of Christianity as
the religion of the empire, its influence had been
felt permeating the entire community. Amid the
disintegration of society it was the sole
conservative element&mdash;the salt which preserved it
from corruption. In the midst of anarchy and
confusion a community was being organized on
a principle previously unknown in the heathen
world, ruling not by terror but by love; by moral
power, not by physical force; inspired by lofty
faith amid a world of unbelief, and cultivating
moral purity amid the reeking abominations of a
sensual age.</p>

<p>We should do scant justice to the blameless
character, simple dignity, and moral purity of the
primitive Christians, if we forgot the thoroughly
effete and corrupt society by which they were
surrounded. It would seem almost impossible
for the Christian graces to grow in such a foetid
atmosphere. Like the snow-white lily springing
in virgin purity from the muddy ooze, they are
more lovely by contrast with the surrounding
pollutions. Like flowers that deck a sepulchre,
breathing their fragrance amid scenes of
corruption and death, are these holy characters, fragrant
with the breath of heaven amid the social
rottenness and moral death of their foul environment.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine, and impossible to
portray, the abominable pollutions of the times.
"Society," says Gibbon, "was a rotten, aimless
chaos of sensuality." It was a boiling Acheron of
seething passions, unhallowed lusts, and tiger
thirst for blood, such as never provoked the wrath
of Heaven since God drowned the world with
water, or destroyed the Cities of the Plain by fire.
Only those who have visited the secret museum
of Naples, or that house which no woman may
enter at Pompeii, and whose paintings no pen
may describe; or, who are familiar with the
scathing denunciations of popular vices by the
Roman satirists and moralists and by the
Christian Fathers, can conceive the appalling depravity
of the age and nation. St. Paul, in his epistle to
the Church among this very people, hints at some
features of their exceeding wickedness. It was to
shame even to speak of the things which were
done by them, but which gifted poets employed
their wit to celebrate. A brutalized monster was
deified as God, received divine homage,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and
beheld all the world at his feet, and the nations
trembled at his nod, while the multitude wallowed
in a sty of sensuality.</p>

<p>Christianity was to be the new Hercules to
cleanse this worse than Augean pollution. The
pure morals and holy lives of the believers were
a perpetual testimony against abounding iniquity,
and a living proof of the regenerating power and
transforming grace of God. For they themselves,
as one of their apologists asserts, "had been
reclaimed from ten thousand vices;" and the
Apostle, describing some of the vilest characters,
exclaims, "such were some of you, but ye are
washed, ye are sanctified." They recoiled with
the utmost abhorrence from the pollutions of the
age, and became indeed "the salt of the earth,"
the sole moral antiseptic to prevent the total
disintegration of society.</p>

<p>Thus amid idolatrous usages and unspeakable
moral degradation the Christians lived, a holy
nation, a peculiar people. "We alone are without
crime," says Tertullian; "no Christian suffers but
for his religion." "Your prisons are full," says
Minutius Felix, "but they contain not one Christian."
And these holy lives were an argument
which even the heathen could not gainsay. The
ethics of paganism were the speculations of the
cultivated few who aspired to the character of
philosophers. The ethics of Christianity were a
system of practical duty affecting the daily life
of the most lowly and unlettered. "Philosophy,"
says Lecky, "may dignify, but is impotent to
regenerate man; it may cultivate virtue, but
cannot restrain vice." But Christianity
introduced a new sense of sin and of holiness, of
everlasting reward and of endless condemnation.
It planted a sublime, impassioned love of Christ
in the heart, inflaming all its affections. It
transformed the character from icy stoicism or
epicurean selfishness to a boundless and uncalculating
self-abnegation and devotion.</p>

<p>This divine principle developed a new instinct
of philanthropy in the soul. A feeling of common
brotherhood knit the hearts of the believers
together. To love a slave! to love an enemy! was
accounted the impossible among the heathen;
yet this incredible virtue they beheld every day
among the Christians. "This surprised them
beyond measure," says Tertullian, "that one man
should die for another." Hence, in the Christian
inscriptions no word of bitterness, even toward
their persecutors, is to be found. Sweet peace,
the peace of God that passeth all understanding,
breathes on every side.</p>

<p>One of the most striking results of the new
spirit of philanthropy which Christianity
introduced is seen in the copious charity of the
primitive Church. Amid the ruins of ancient
palaces and temples, theatres and baths, there are
none of any house of mercy. Charity among the
pagans, was at best, a fitful and capricious fancy.
Among the Christians it was a vast and vigorous
organization and was cultivated with noble
enthusiasm. And the great and wicked city of
Rome, with its fierce oppressions and inhuman
wrongs, afforded amplest opportunity for the
Christ-like ministrations of love and pity. There
were Christian slaves to succour, exposed to
unutterable indignities and cruel punishment, even
unto crucifixion for conscience' sake. There were
often martyrs' pangs to assuage, the aching
wounds inflicted by the rack or by the nameless
tortures of the heathen to bind up, and their
bruised and broken hearts to cheer with heavenly
consolation. There were outcast babes to pluck
from death. There were a thousand forms of
suffering and sorrow to relieve; and the ever-present
thought of Him who came, not to be ministered
unto, but to minister and to give His life a
ransom for many, was an inspiration to heroic
sacrifice and self-denial. And doubtless the
religion of mercy won its way to many a stony
pagan heart by the winsome spell of the saintly
charities and heavenly benedictions of the
persecuted Christians. This sublime principle has
since covered the earth with its institutions of
mercy, and with a passionate zeal has sought out
the woes of raan in every land, in order to their
relief.</p>

<p>In the primitive Church voluntary collections<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
were regularly made for the poor, the aged, the
sick, the brethren in bonds, and for the burial
of the dead. All fraud and deceit was abhorred,
and all usury forbidden. Many gave all their
goods to feed the poor. "Our charity dispenses
more in the streets," says Tertullian to the
heathen, "than your religion in your temples."
He upbraids them for offering to the gods only
the worn-out and useless, such as is given to
dogs. "How monstrous is it," exclaims the
Alexandrian Clement, "to live in luxury while
so many are in want." "As you would receive,
show mercy," says Chrysostom; "make God your
debtor that you may receive again with usury."
The Church at Antioch, he tells us, maintained
three thousand widows and virgins, besides the
sick and the poor. Under the persecuting Decius
the widows and the infirm under the care of
the Church at Rome were fifteen hundred.
"Behold the treasures of the Church," said St.
Lawrence pointing to the aged and poor, when
the heathen prefect came to confiscate its wealth.
The Church in Carthage sent a sum equal to
four thousand dollars to ransom Christian
captives in Numidia. St. Ambrose sold the sacred
vessels of the Church of Milan to rescue prisoners
from the Goths, esteeming it their truest
consecration to the service of God. "Better clothe
the Christ," says living temples of Jerome, "than
adorn the temples of stone." "God has no need
of plates and dishes," said Acacius, Bishop of
Amida, and he ransomed therewith a number of
poor captives. For a similar purpose Paulinus
of Nola sold the treasures of his beautiful church,
and, it is said, even sold himself into African
slavery. The Christian traveller was hospitably
entertained by the faithful; and before the close
of the fourth century asylums were provided for
the sick, aged, and infirm. During the Decian
persecution, when the streets of Carthage were
strewn with the dying and the dead, the
Christians, with the scars of recent torture and
imprisonment upon them, exhibited the nobility of
a gospel revenge in their care for their
fever-smitten persecutors, and seemed to seek the
martyrdom of Christian charity, even more
glorious than that they had escaped. In the
plague of Alexandria, six hundred <i>parabolani</i>
periled their lives to succour the dying and bury
the dead. Julian urged the pagan priests to
imitate the virtues of the lowly Christians.</p>

<p>Christianity also gave a new sanctity to human
life. The exposure of infants was a fearfully
prevalent pagan practice, which even Plato and
Aristotle permitted. We have had evidences of
the tender charity of the Christians in rescuing
these foundlings from death, or from a fate more
dreadful still&mdash;a life of infamy. Christianity
also emphatically affirmed the Almighty's "canon
'gainst self-slaughter," which crime the pagans
had even exalted into a virtue. It taught that a
patient endurance of suffering, like Job's,
exhibited a loftier courage than Cato's renunciation
of life.</p>

<p>We have thus seen from the testimony of the
Catacombs, the immense superiority, in all the
elements of true dignity and excellence, of
primitive Christianity to the corrupt civilization
by which it was surrounded. It ennobled the
character and purified the morals of mankind. It
raised society from the ineffable slough into which
it had fallen, imparted tenderness and fidelity to
the domestic relations of life, and enshrined
marriage in a sanctity before unknown.
Notwithstanding the corruptions by which it became
infected in the days of its power and pride, even
the worst form of Christianity was infinitely
preferable to the abominations of paganism. It
gave a sacredness before unconceived to human
life. It averted the sword from the throat of the
gladiator, and, plucking helpless infancy from
exposure to untimely death, nourished it in
Christian homes. It threw the ægis of its protection
over the slave and the oppressed, raising them
from the condition of beasts to the dignity of men
and the fellowship of saints. With an unwearied
and passionate charity it yearned over the
suffering and the sorrowing everywhere, and created
a vast and comprehensive organization for their
relief, of which the world had before no example
and had formed no conception. It was a holy
Vestal, ministering at the altar of humanity,
witnessing ever of the Divine, and keeping the
sacred fire burning, not for Rome, but for the
world. Its winsome gladness and purity, in an
era of unspeakable pollution and sadness, revived
the sinking heart of mankind, and made possible
a Golden Age in the future transcending far that
which poets pictured in the past. It blotted out
cruel laws, like those of Draco, written in blood,
and led back Justice, long banished, to the
judgment seat. It ameliorated the rigours of the penal
code, and, as experience has shown, lessened the
amount of crime. It created an art purer and
loftier than that of paganism; and a literature
rivaling in elegance of form, and surpassing in
nobleness of spirit, the sublimest productions of
the classic muse. Instead of the sensual
conceptions of heathenism, polluting the soul, it
supplied images of purity, tenderness, and pathos,
which fascinated the imagination and hallowed
the heart. It taught the sanctity of suffering
and of weakness, and the supreme majesty of
gentleness and truth.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The entire subject of Christian evidences
from the Catacombs, which has been so cursorily
glanced at in the foregoing pages, is treated with great
fullness of detail and copious pictorial illustration in a
work by the writer, "The Catacombs of Rome, and their
Testimony Relative to Primitive Christianity." Cr. 8vo,
560 pp., 136 engravings. New York: Phillips &amp; Hunt.
Price $2.50. It discusses at length the structure, origin,
and history of the Catacombs; their art and symbolism;
their epigraphy as illustrative of the theology, ministry,
rites, and institutions of the primitive Church, and
Christian Life and Character in the early ages. The
gradual corruption of doctrine and practice and
introduction of Romanist errors, as the <i>cultus</i> of Mary, the
primacy of Peter, prayers of the dead, the invocation of
saints, the notion of purgatory, the celibacy of the clergy
rite of monastic orders, and other allied subjects are
fully treated.</p></blockquote>
